            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He seduced People whom they call Quakers, not without cause, because the Devil first began with them, with that trick of his, to make people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was something extraordinary in the Work; they out of a railing spirit, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what that spirit is which they are led by, for good Angels and Spirits will not give railing tearms, no not to Devils: They call me a Persecutor, a whited Wall, a painted Sepulchre, one that keeps Swearers and Drunkards in my house: The Devil is the Father of lies and liars; let any one of them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63974:3"/> make it appear, that one man or woman in my house is a Swearer, or a Drunkard, and that known to me, and they shall not be accounted for that, lyars or false railers, which else they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve: I am not a persecutor of their persons, but of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable pride, and other sins, wherein I persecute the Devil who fills their hearts with these lusts, and if it should not be suppressed in time, it would grow to a <hi>Munster</hi> business, which in <hi>Germany</hi> began, and went on upon these very Principles of theirs (as whosoever will read the History thereof, in the tenth Chapter of <hi>Sleyden,</hi> shall apparently see and be satisfied in) I could be glad with all my heart that I could use any means to withdraw them from these errors of their ways, which if they will go on in, and not be perswaded by those who seek their salvation, nor endure to hearken unto wholsome Doctrine, but heap up unto themselves Teachers after their own lusts, not enduring others; these Errors will in the issue prove damnable, and Doctrines of Devils, as indeed they are. The Devil is a subtile enemy, and like a Serpent, turns and windes himself every way to deceive, therefore it is most necessary, with care and watchfulness to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his cunning sleights and crafty devices, which he makes use of to destroy mens souls, and to deceive them as he did <hi>Eve</hi> our first Parent; and to those who will not wink with their eyes, but be willing to see the truth, this will appear very clearly in his carrying on of this dangerous delusion, from the beginning all along, as those who have observed it, and have been rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd can affirm and prove.</p>
                     <p>At the first, he endeavored to carry on all in a ranting way, knowing, that if men might be brought to believe, they might enjoy their lusts, and yet go to Heaven, and be in no fear of Hells torments, this would please the multitude very much, and gain him Disciples enough to follow such a Doctrine; therefore he set up <hi>Cop</hi> and <hi>Coppen,</hi> and such like, to teach the people to turn the grace of God into wantonness; and if they might not Drink, and Swear, and Whore, and please themselves in fulfilling their Lusts, then Christ dyed in vain: This, men of credit and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty told me they heard that vile man <hi>Cop</hi> speak at <hi>Hock-Norton</hi> Lodge, and they will testifie and prove the same: What is this,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63974:3"/> but (as the Apostle saith) <hi>to trample under foot the precious blood of the Son of God,</hi> whereby we are cleansed from our sins, and which is of more value, to deliver us from the wrath to come, then the sufferings of all Men and Angels for ever, which could never have done it? And what a damnable Doctrine is this, which by these men the Devil then broached? so to the same end, that men might enjoy their filthy Lusts which pleased them, <hi>Coppen</hi> would teach them there was neither Heaven nor Hell.</p>
                     <p>In these sad and perilous times, wherein we live, and which the Apostle speaks of, <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3. when we see <hi>men are lovers of their own lusts, and despisers of those who are good;</hi> the Lord in just judgement hath let loose that enemy of mankinde, the Devil, to seduce men, and cast upon them strong delusions that they may believe lies, because they receive not the truth in the love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but delight in unrighteousness, and in satisfaction of their own lusts: Being unchained and let loose, he first appeared in this shape (as I have said) carrying on his work in a way of ranting, drunkenness, filthiness, and all maner of fleshly lusts; but when he saw this did too much discover his black face, and not onely to those who had any sense of Religion in them, but to civil men, that were men and not beasts, it was odious and abominable, then the cunning Serpent turns himself into another shape, and to deceive the simple, puts on a shew of Mortification, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to turn himself into an Angel of light; but wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted this Mortification, onely in voluntary humility (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle terms it, in the second of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> the last verse) and will-worship, <hi>not sparing the body, but in order to the setting up of the flesh,</hi> for a greater pride there could hardly be in a Devil, then by all other carriages towards men did shew forth it self in this people: What was their humility shewed forth by, but in not wearing Band-strings, nor Hat-bands, no Laces on their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, no Cuffs, nor such like fooleries? Was not this voluntary humi ity and will-worship? (as it is there called) for this is not at all appointed of God to manifest humility, but an invention of their own brains alone; and what comes from the flesh, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that which sets up the flesh (as the Apostle there saith) Let any man observe the begging Fryars amongst the Papists, and he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63974:4"/> shall finde them in these foolish inventions of theirs (to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Humility and Mortification) by going far beyond these Quakers; and yet who knows not, that hath any understanding, that these begging Fryars, and the Carthusians, another sort of your mortified Priests, to be nothing else but Papistical wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worshippers; and unto this, the Devil now, in this second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his, is carrying on the Quakers, and to that end, it is manifest he hath, and still doth imploy many Jesuits and Priests among them, who under counterfeit Names and Professions, mingle themselves with them, and become their Teachers and Instructers.</p>
                     <p>I shall a little discover the way and manner of the Devils car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on this delusion from the beginning, that the madnesse thereof may appear to all men, as that of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> did, who withstood <hi>Moses:</hi> The first rise of it was from the North, and from thence, as a Plague, it spread it self over the greatest part of the Kingdom: and we need not wonder at it, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil found out a bait which ignorant people, who usually are most proud, would easily and readily be taken with: that is, they must yeild respect to none, but esteem themselves as good as the best, thinking there was no superiority or inferiority amongst men, and so casting the fifth Commandment out of the Tables, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of Religion, carrying on a Levelling Principle, the onely way to confusion: O how did this take with the vulgar sort, and please them, when they thought they should enjoy that liberty, as to be under no rule, no reverence to be given either to Magistrate or Minister, Parent or Master, but as Beasts, or worse, be guided by the spirit within them, that is, the Devils impulses and delusions, which he hereby made way for; and this was it that made it so easily embraced, and so suddenly spread it about the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The principal Instruments which the Devil in the beginning made use of, were one <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Naylor;</hi> this <hi>Fox,</hi> by one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he used to draw a Gentlewoman to be his Disciple, made it manifest, that he exercised Witch-craft, for presenting to her a Bracelet, and desiring that she would wear it for his sake; after she had it, she was importunate with her Husband that she might
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63974:4"/> goe and hear that holy man <hi>Fox,</hi> her Husband being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, perswaded her to the contrary, but nothing would prevail; at last, he told her he would go with her, and knowing that <hi>Fox</hi> had given her a Bracelet to wear, that he might make tryal of this device whether it were Witch-craft or no, he offered to carry her to their Meeting-place, but desired that he might see the Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which when she had taken off from her arm, &amp; was in the way, her mind changed, and she desired her Husband to go back again to their house, he thereupon, that he might make a further try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of it, put the Bracelet upon one of their Maids, and she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently was mad to run to their Meetings: Then he took it and put it upon his own arm, which when he had worn a little while, he found himself beginning to be possessed with a desire of going to <hi>Fox</hi> and his company; whereupon he threw the Bracelet into the Fire, not doubting but there was Witch-craft in the business: This I have heard that the Gentleman hath affirmed, and will make good. Now that in the beginning it was carryed on by witch-craft, and many possessed with Devils, is apparent, if what was done in the North, and will be proved, and what was seen here, be but advisedly and without prejudice considered. Read Mr. <hi>Farmers</hi> Book, a Minister of <hi>Bristol,</hi> where you shall see proved what was done in the Northern parts, in the first rise of this mad delusion; then consider, after that prating woman <hi>Audler</hi> came to <hi>Banbury,</hi> what was done and practiced, not onely upon men and women, but upon children, falling down foaming at the mouth, Quaking, and using unnatural gestures, as the childe that was possessed with the Devil, whose father brought him to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to dispossess: The manner of it was not much unlike this: But now the Devil perceiving that it begins to be suspected to be either possession, witch-craft or a cheating trick, as I think there was all of them in the practice, he leaves it off, and we hear no more of it, lest he should be discovered: For their other great Apostle sent extraordinarily, as they and he pretends, <hi>James Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> what he is grown to be, I wonder all that pretend to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, do not observe, and thereby see what this madness is come unto, and repent themselves that ever they were led into such an error: He blasphemously makes himself Christ, a thing that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63974:5"/> every Christians heart should tremble at, a thing more to be abhor'd, and worthy of greater punishment then Theft or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or any breach of the second Table: if he had been execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it, as in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time <hi>Hacket</hi> was, he did deserve it; but our Saviour hath told us before, <hi>That false Prophets shall come, and false Christs;</hi> but withal doth admonish us, That because he told us of it before-hand, therefore we should take heed <hi>that we did not so much as go out to see them, or hear them,</hi> when those who were seduced by them should tell us of them where they were, <hi>either in the desert, or in the secret chamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rs.</hi> O that this discovery of the blasphemous madness, this delusion is grown unto, in one of their chiefest Deluders and Instruments of Satan, who hath hereby discovered what his aim and end is in this delusion, might be a means to reduce those deluded people from such a damnable Error as this is, by Gods just Judgement, made appear to be, and to grow up unto: that this their chief Doctor, <hi>James Naylor,</hi> should proceed at length to such a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, it might well be expected, when as it is related in Mr. <hi>Farmers</hi> Book, the Minister of <hi>Bristol,</hi> that this <hi>Naylor</hi> before, out of his horrid pride, durst affirm to others, That he was as good as God, as just as God, as righteous as God, as holy as God: Was this man to be endured, and his Blasphemies to be suffered? God directs in his Word, <hi>That a Blasphemer shall be put to death;</hi> And is such a one to be made use of for a Teacher and Instructer, as he hath been the chief to the Quakers?</p>
                     <p>I shall now proceed to speak something of their Doctrines and Practice, that every sober man may consider how contrary they are to the Word of God, which is given to us as a rule to direct us how we ought to live here, and by which we shall be judged hereafter: And this Word which is given by Inspiration from the Holy Ghost (as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith) is more sure, and more to be heeded and followed, then Visions that appear out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or Revelations within, because such, men may mistake, or being transient, and soon gon, may forget; but this word is sure, and endureth for ever, and is ever present with us, given of God to be a light unto our feet, and a lamp to direct us in the right way.</p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63974:5"/>
                     <p>For matter of Doctrine, the Devils chief aim and endeavor is to make them cast away this Word of Truth, as a dead letter, as Ink and Paper, and such other terms, he puts into their heads to make them slight it withal, and then teacheth them not to be led by this rule, but by the spirit within them, and the voice that speaks within them, whereby when he hath brought them to this, he hath fitted them for all his damnable Delusions and Suggestions, making them believe they are the spirits voice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, and by that they must be guided, &amp; practice accordingly: As <hi>Felton,</hi> who thereupon stabbed and murthered the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and said, <hi>He had impulses of the spirit moving him to do so:</hi> In like manner have this deluded People been dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the North, when Satan had laid this foundation for his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, that they are to be led by the Light within them, and the spirit speaking within them, which is no other but the evil spirit of darknesse. One of them was met riding, with a cord about his middle, and asked whither he went, he answered, <hi>The spirit had sent him to hang such a Minister:</hi> Another of them, a base Trull and Whore, went in the night to a mans bed, and told him, <hi>The Father had commanded her to come to bed to him;</hi> he answered, <hi>If that were so, he must not deny it:</hi> This I heard was proved before a Justice, to whom the Man of the House, where it was done, brought them: These abominations of filthinesse, murther, and such other sins, these Devilish Doctrines of theirs lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                     <p>Other things of like nature I heard of in the North: a Maid being by one of them solicited to filthiness, and told, <hi>That all such things were lawfull,</hi> thereupon left them, &amp; she came and told it to a godly Minister: Hereby observe what this Doctrine of theirs produceth, and giveth the Devil opportunity to lead them unto, when they must go according to the spirit within them, and the voice within them, and lay aside the Word of God, by which the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to try the spirits, whether they are of God or no; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false spirits are going about to delude: Now there is no other rule to try the spirits by, whether they be of God or not, but onely the Word of God, according to which, if they speak not, or move not within us, there is no light nor truth within them,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63974:6"/> as the Scripture saith, but they are the spirits of darkness and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion: This foundation of the Scriptures, the Devil by his false Prophets strives in the first place to subvert and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw; and having once obtained that, he easily leads these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded People into all manner of errors and base lusts.</p>
                     <p>Another Doctrine of theirs is, <hi>That they are perfect; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin:</hi> This divers of them have pleaded and maintained, as old <hi>Hix</hi> told me <hi>Simon Temsom</hi> did, and it may be proved of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others: Now the most holy man that is in the world, or ever was, that was a meer man alone since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> will by his own experience, and the knowledge of his own heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this as most false, and indeed, tending to ranting, that nothing they doe is a sin (except they think it so) and therefore they may doe any thing, so their conscience condemn them not for it, which they have seared as with an hot iron: Let us now examine this Doctrine of theirs, by the word which they hold, to give them a liberty to doe any thing, for nothing they doe is sin: Look into the old Testament, in the Prayer of <hi>Solomon,</hi> where he saith, <hi>No man liveth &amp; sinneth not: Eccl.</hi> 7.20. Look into the Gospel, <hi>St. James</hi> saith, <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> c. 3, v. 2. Our Saviour teacheth us to pray daily for the forgiveness of our sins, which is needlesse if we be perfect and have no sin: If you say they must doe so who have sin, not they who have none, shew that man who needs not daily bread for his sustenance: In the same Prayer that he is to pray for that, he is commanded to pray for the forgivenesse of his sins daily; but upon this account, that they are perfect and have no sin, they are brought to cast off Prayer altogether, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of themselves, whereas we are commanded to pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, that is, constantly: Look into the first Epistle of St. <hi>John chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 10. <hi>If we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us: If we say we have not sinned, we make him a lyer, and the truth is not in us:</hi> If we confess our sins, he will forgive us, and by the blood of Christ cleanse us from all sin, but then we must acknowledge and confess we have sin, and are sinners: You will say we have had sin, but now being cleansed we have none: You deceive your selves (as the Apostle saith) and know not this truth, the truth is not in you. There is a double
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63974:6"/> cleansing of sinne; The one is of the guilt of it in the sight of God, that God, his justice being satisfied by the suffering and bloud-sheding of our Lord Christ doth not impute sinne to us; but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquit us of it, in respect of our being justified before him; Another is of the power and operation of sinne in our mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies while we live here, and that by the spirit of Christ in us, is more and more subdued and mortified, that it hath not dominion over us, but not wholly and perfectly taken away, whilest we are in the body here in this world, but left in us to exercise us unto humility by a sight of our own vilenesse, and to make us the more to see &amp; admire the riches of God's grace, to such vile and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy creatures as thereby we see our selves to be: This is manifest in all God's Saints, and acknowledged by the most holy of them that know and observe their own hearts, as the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> none more perfect, than he that was a mere man, nor any raised up to higher revelations, yet he saith, he was not perfect, as those Quakers say; but he saith he presseth forwards still to the marke of perfection; but had not yet attained to it, neither shall any in this life, <hi>Philipians</hi> 3: and <hi>Romans</hi> the 7th: there is and will be still a flesh, and corruption in the flesh, even in the most holy, and most spiritual striving against, and lusting against the spirit, which dwels in the Saints, as he sheweth in that 7th chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> I will end this manifestation of their delusion herein by answering an objection which they may bring out of the Epistle of <hi>John, chap:</hi> 3. <hi>v:</hi> 9th: he that is borne of God sinneth not, for the seed of God abideth in him, so that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sinne, because he is borne of God; the very reason given answereth the objection, if rightly considered, and gives such an interpretation of the place, as makes it consist with, and not contradict what the Apostle hath said before; for the seed of God abideth in him, that is, the grace of regeneration abideth in him, which is not at all in an unregenerate man, who is not borne of God; so that the words are thus to be understood; A regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man truely sanctified and borne of God, cannot so sin as an unregenerate man, who never had any true grace or seed of God remaining in him, that is, he cannot sinne totally, and finally, he cannot sinne without reluctancy of spirit, without the spirit stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63974:7"/> against the flesh, as in the 7th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> you may read the seed of God remaining in him, will oppose and rise up against the lusts that stirre and strive in him; but in a man not borne of God there is no such thing, therefore he sinnes totally without any opposition of grace, because there is none in him; again he cannot sinne finally, that is, without repentance and turning to God again; for that seed of Grace remaining in him, will in time spring up and restore him again to his first condition by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, so that the true understanding of this place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, will not contradict (as I say.) the other; but only sheweth the difference in sinning betwixt a man regenerate, and unregenerate, and is a place that confuteth the Arminians, who teach, that a man who hath true grace and the seed of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in him, may not withstanding totally and finally fall from grace, which is directly contrary to this Scripture, written by the Apostle by the inspiration of the spirit: Let us therefore take heed that we rightly interpret the Scripture, which by comparing one place with another, we shall best be able to doe, otherwise we may pervert the Scripture, as many doe, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, to their own destruction; The Scripture righty interpreted doth never contradict it selfe.</p>
                     <p>There is another delusion which they entertain, which as that reverend Divine <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, commeth from the Anabaptists of <hi>Germany,</hi> and I have perceived it amongst some of them, which are in <hi>Bloxham,</hi> which is, that it is unlawfull to sweare at all, though the matter be of that consequence that requires it, and a man be lawfully called to undertake it: I shall first shew how contrary this is to the practise of the most godly men and Saints in Scripture, both in the Old and new Testament, and also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the commands of God, as being a part of his honor and worship: Then I will answer those places they bring for it, and shew the true meaning of those places. For the practise of the holy men of God, they are so many, and it was so usuall, that it were too much to reckon them up all; I shall instance in a few, <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> Gen: 21: <hi>Abraham's</hi> Steward of his house to <hi>Abraham</hi> at his desire, and <hi>Joseph</hi> to his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a multitude of others in like manner; and this was not when a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63974:7"/> Magistrate required it, which then is not to be refused; but it was sufficient that the matter it selfe was of that consequence, and satisfaction therein to be given so necessary, that it was lawfull for private men, and is so, to bind themselves by the name of God, which is the greatest satisfaction that can be given, and when this is done with reverence and godly fear, in respect of the name of God, and thereupon observed with all care and faithfullnesse, God accounts it as an honouring of his name, and not at all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in vaine; for such an Oath is to end controversies, and satisfy all feares and doubts; upon this occasion and upon these few examples, I may take away another scruple which indeed is no part of the Oath, or worship of God in the invocation of his name therein; but a mere civil circumstance to demonstrate, that I am the man that do oblige my selfe by taking this Oath, and that is, <hi>laying my hand upon the book,</hi> for but that the use and custome is such now, that hereby I declare that I oblige my selfe by this Oath, to lay my hand upon the Table as well as the book, were all one, and this civil circumstance (for it is no other) why may I not as well performe in this manner, as by putting my hand under the thigh of him to whom I swear, as was the custome then to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that they did take the Oath, as you may see in <hi>Joseph,</hi> and in <hi>Abraham's</hi> servant: and in the new Testament there is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of St <hi>Paul</hi> in a case of great concernment for the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor: chap:</hi> 1: <hi>v:</hi> 23. see the 10th chap: of the <hi>Revelations, vers.</hi> 6: the example of the Angell: If swearing upon just occasion, and in matters requiring the same, which are of moment, were unlawfull, the Scripture would not give us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it, both of the holyest men, and of holy Angels. I will now shew that God commands it as a part of honour and worship, when it is done with reverence to his name, and thereupon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served with all faithfulnesse, and not with that slightnesse, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse and negligence, as to my grief I see it is done at this day. First, I will say, it is commanded in the third Commandement, where the taking of God's name in vain is forbidden; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will rightly understand the ten Commandements, must know this, that where ever it is commanded in the negative, there the affirmative is to be understood, and where the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63974:8"/> is expressed, there the negative likewise is to be understood, as the first commandement is given in the negative; Thou shalt have none other Gods but me, that must be understood, thou shalt have me, and me alone for thy God, so in the second, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe images to worship by them, this is given in the negative, will any man say that the affirmative is not there commanded? but that we may lay aside all worship? no this is commanded hereby, that as God must be our God alone, as in the first commandment, so in this second, by the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of worship after our own inventions, we are commanded to worship God only after his own directions, and by his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; not otherwise so in this third Commandement we are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to use God's name vainly, which negative infers that we ought when we are called to use it, to use it to his honor, with reverence and feare, with truth and care to performe what thereby we have obliged our selves unto; in the forbidding the vaine and profane use of it, the holy and reverent use of it is commanded: and goe through all the commandments in the decalogue, and you must thus understand them: to confirme this, I shall set downe the places, at least some of them, for there are many where this is expresly commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13, &amp; 10.20. <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> 4.2. <hi>Isay:</hi> 65.16: and 45: and 23: <hi>Ezra:</hi> 10.5: <hi>Exod:</hi> 22.11: many other places might be alleaged, but these are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; having made this cleare as I conceive, to men, that are not wilfull in their way, yet I will answer those places which they bring to confirme them in their error; the first is in the 5th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where our Saviour expounding the law, sheweth the false exposition thereof used to be given by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who, to their own distruction, thinking they were to be justified by the fulfilling of the Law, made it such by their interpretation that they thought they might fulfill it, as in the 6th commandment, and in the 7th; and so likewise in this, our Saviour shewing their grosse errors in all. In this third Commandment they held and taught, that if a man did not sweare falsly, his swearing was not sinne, how vainly and profanely soever he sweared, and how or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in his communication: Another falshood which they held and taught was, that if they did in their ordinary communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63974:8"/> swear by heaven or by earth, or by Jerusalem, or any other thing, and did not use the name of God, it was no sinne or breach of the third commandment: our Saviour sheweth their ignorance and falshood herein, by telling them, first, that in their ordinary communication, though the thing were true, and what they had done or would doe, yet this was a taking of the name of God in vaine to sweare in their ordinary communication and talking one with an other, when the thing was not of that moment, as to require the name of God to be made use of therin, neither had they a calling so to doe, as if a man would tell his neighbour, that he had been at the Market, which was true, and when there was no use thereof would vainly swear it; or tell him he would to morrow goe a Journy, and did performe it, and not break his Word, yet vainly swear it, when there was no cause so to doe, which how usually it is done in this age amongst us, should make us mourne for it; this those ignorant Jewes thought was no breach of the third Commandment, though the very words of the Commandment, thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, shewed the falshood thereof, and this was it that our Saviour here reproved, that false interpretation of this Commandment, that men might sweare in their communication one with another, as much as they would, so it were not falsly, how vainly soever it were and needlesly, therefore our Saviour tels them that in their communication one with a nother, yea and nay, avering what was true and denying what was false, was sufficient without using the name of God vainly and irreverently when there was no calling thereto, nor need thereof, for in such cases it is vaine and from the Divell. So likewise he tels them, it is a sinne to sweare vainly by a Creature, which the Jewes taught was no sin, if the name of God was not used; for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, and the goodnesse of God is to be seen in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if we would use the name thereof in an Oath, and therefore it is not to be used in vaine, nor otherwise in an Oath, but when we signify thereby that we bind our selves by the great God who in such a creature manifesteth himselfe; and his greatnesse to us. For that in St <hi>James:</hi> 5: 12: it hath the same sense to avoid vaine hasty and profane swearing, which may be gathered the better
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63974:9"/> from that which immediatly goes before, which is his exhortation to patience and long suffering in their afflictions and persecutions; for impatiency in oppressions, and afflictions, is apt to bring forth anger, passion, and that, swearing, and thereupon he in the next verse gives them this admonition. I have been the longer in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these places and the true meaning of them, because I know these are the only props they make use of to uphold their error; and I will conclude with this, that it is a great ignorance or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to imagine, that our Saviour, God blessed over all, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law-giver, and therefore Interpreter thereof, would interpret his Law in this place otherwise than stands with his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in other places of Scripture, as I have shewed clearly, and with the practise of the most holy of his Saints in obedience to those commands.</p>
                     <p>I will come to another device of Sathan, wereby he endeavours to bring them to cast off all ordinances, and separate themselves as those who (as <hi>Jude</hi> saith) are sensuall not having the spirit: and I wish they would read that Epistle and rightly apply it: they must not, they say, come into Steeple Churches, but they will creep into houses, they must not heare Priests, as they call them, which, they say, preach for hire, because they take that maintainance which the Law gives them; and what ground have they for this? these Churches have been abused to Idol-worship, and they must not be like Idolaters, nor worship God as they have done: igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people! they do not understand how to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween false worship and true: to worship God after the same manner that Idolaters doe, after their own inventions, is false worship; but to worship God in the same time and place, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his institution and ordinances; this is true worship; for time and place of meeting for worship is God's ordinance, and if by Idolaters God's ordinances be abused, we may and must rightly use them; but not their inventions, which is false worship; they may as well say you must not pray, because Idolaters pray, they abuse the ordinance of God, but we are not therefore to leave it, but rightly to use it; to pray before an Image we must not so as they do, this is their invention, not commanded but forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God, but what an ignorance would it be to say or think,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63974:9"/> we may not therefore pray at all, because they pray? so we may not come to a meeting place, where they have used to come, nor at 9 of the clock, because they use to meet at that time? Time and place for Gods worship, is Gods ordinance as well as worship it's selfe: Gods ordinances abused we may rightly use, notwithstanding mens inventions in God's worship those we may not use; why doe not these people as well say they must not pray in their houses? for what house is there which in the time of Popery had not Idols wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in it? for preaching for hire, wherewith they slander falsly honest Ministers, who seek their salvation rather than their goods, and this they raile upon them for, because they receive that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance which by the law is allowed them, and which Tithes if they did not receive, it were none of theirs, as you may see by impropriations, neither should they have it, if it were taken from the maintainance of the Ministers, as you may see in <hi>Wales,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have no right to it, for these 500 yeares if not more, they who have bought or sold land, have done it at such a price, as Tithes are excepted, and not reckoned into the price, and therefore none was due to him that buyes the land. But that which makes them thus clamor, because they pay Tithes, is upon this false ground, wherein they are deceived, thinking that if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters had it not, they should enjoy it; whereas it would be more rigorously and violently taken from them than now it is, as the example in <hi>Wales</hi> will manifest this I am willing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme people of, who are so much for taking away Tithes from the Ministers; but to raile at Ministers for receiving maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for preaching the Gospel, as your impudent prating wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe, were they not shamelesse, would know as the Apostle saith, it were a shame for them to take upon them to teach and preach to men, this is so contrary to the word of God, that it directly contradicts what the Apostle proves to be a duty to be done, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14: and though he would not doe it at that time himselfe, when the Gospel was first preached, that he might give no hindrance thereunto, (as he saith) giving that for the reason, yet he saith he had power to doe it, and it was ordained of God to be done in the times of the Gospel, as well as in the time under the Law; but the truth is, all this (as I have said)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63974:10"/> is the Divels devise to make those deluded people cast off the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and heap up to themselves teachers after their own lusts, and such as will lead them on and encourage them to fulfil those lusts, a company of prating women, and ignorant men, making a noise as if they were fervent and zealous, speaking those things they understand not, and the same things twenty times over again. Though other things which they hold and are taught might be observed, and are so by other men in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, yet I will let them passe, and conclude with one doctrine which they are taught, which is most dangerous of all, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a damnable error, &amp; therefore I desire they may be delivered out of it, lest by holding of it they perish, that is, that they must not expect to be sav'd by Christ's sufferings at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> so many hundred yeares agoe, but by Christ's sufferings within them, and by his work within them, which is nothing else but their own workes, which Christ workes in them, a Doctrine of Popery, and which they may well think the Priests and Jesuits (which it is known doe mingle themselves amongst them to be their teachers) have infused into them, for were there any workes of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought by Christ in them, which never will be, before they be justified by his workes and sufferings for them, yet the worke of sanctification cannot justify any man, they are the effect, and so the evidences of a man's being justified by faith in the death and sufferings of the Lord Christ for us, but he that casts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that, and doth not cast his soule wholly upon it for justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, shall never be justified, nor ever be sanctified; what are all the workes in us, or the righteousnesse of the best of men that ever were? no better for justification, than filthy raggs, dung and drosse, (as <hi>Paul</hi> saith of his own) if you cast not your Souls wholly by faith upon Christ's sufferings upon the crosse at Jerusalem, where he bore our sins upon the tree, you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be cleansed from sinne, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> the 9. <hi>chap: vers:</hi> 12, 14, 15, 26, 28: he it is that puts away sinne by the sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for sinne at Jerusalem, and by offering himselfe once to beare our sinnes, by his bloud they are purged, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 <hi>chap: vers:</hi> 24: having made it appeare how contrary their doctrines are to the word of God. I shall now shew you what their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise

I will now pull off the vizard wherewith you pretend to justifie this incivillity and unjust carriage of yours, not understanding the scripture, but perverting it to your own ends falsly; you say you must respect no man's person, you will not apply this, as wheresoever it is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it is to be applied, for then it will not serve your turne; it is alwayes meant in giving judgment, in speaking the truth when we are called so to doe, then we are not to respect mens persons whether poore or rich, whether high or low, to draw us to speake what is untrue, in bearing witnesse, or giving false judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any case to please men whether poore or rich, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19: <hi>vers.</hi> 15: so <hi>Job</hi> 32: <hi>the two last verses: Elihu</hi> when he was to speak and shew where the three friends of <hi>Job</hi> had failed, and where <hi>Job</hi> himselfe was to blame, he professeth there, that with out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons of the one side or the other he would speak the truth sincerely, &amp; no titles of flattery to any should divert him from so doing; &amp; that it is thus to be understood, the speech separate he useth and the occasion thereof, in that place maks itmost apparent: so in <hi>James</hi> he reproves them, that humour and flatter the rich, and despise the poore, neither is to be done, and these scriptures rightly understood, &amp; rightly applyed according to the true sense &amp; meaning of them, which appears by what is handled where they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63974:12"/> are spoken, do not at all contradict those commands in Scripture before alleadged, to give honor &amp; Titles of honor to those to whom of right they belong. I will conclude with one place which will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently shew how these deluded people erre from what God commandeth, <hi>Levit:</hi> 19: <hi>vers: the</hi> 32: thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God, I am the Lord; see how this Commandment is closed up, that if they obey it not, they shew that they doe not fear God, who hath lay'd this Commandment upon them; now these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are so farre from regarding this Commandment so charged upon them, that they are so far from rising up before, or honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the face of the ancient by any expression of respect shewed unto them, that they make themselves rather to become that Judgment which God threatneth against a nation which he is displeased withall, in <hi>Isay:</hi> 3: <hi>vers:</hi> 5th: the child shall behave himselfe proudly against the ancient, and the base, against the honourable; here is a perfect description of these proud persons in this time, and no man that observeth their carriage can deny it; I shall observe another carriage of theirs or two, wherein the divell prepares them to cast off God's Ordinances, to set up their own inventions, directly contrary to his commands, and withall to fit times and places for filthinesse and Lewdnesse, they will not hear a Minister ordained of God by the Apostles directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is by the choise and election of the people, the charge of whose Soules he is to undertake, so it is appointed by the Apostle, ordaine Elders in every Congregation by the lifting up of hands, which was the manner of Electing and choosing Ministers; now such a one is a Minister of God called as he appointed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in an ordinary way: those who were extraordinarily cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, these to make that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, were endued with extraordinary gifts of working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that it might appeare they were called and sent of God, but Pastors and Teachers were called in this ordinary way I have said, and that by direction of God delivered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; these the Quakers will not hear, but revile and disturbe in the execution of their office, but a wandring man that will say the spirit moves him to teach, although they know not what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63974:13"/> he is, &amp; often it hath fallen out they have been Priests and Jesuits, these they will hear and run after, and be deluded by; nay which is so expresly against the command of God, as nothing can be more, they will suffer impudent women to assume authority to preach &amp; teach, as Goodwife <hi>Audland</hi> &amp; others, who run from their houses, and husbands and children, where they are commanded to stay at home, and impudently and shamelesly take upon them to preach in the congregations. Now I desire any that will not be obstinately blind, to consider how directly contrary to what the Apostle commands from God, this practise is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14: <hi>vers: the</hi> 34.35: Let your women keep silence in the Church, that is, in the congregation, for it is not permitted unto them to speak, but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the Law, and if they will learne any thing (that is,) if they have any doubt, let them aske their husbands at home, for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the Church; then in the 37th <hi>verse:</hi> he expresly tels them, that this which he writes is the commandment of the Lord, and will you deluded people set up such teachers, and run after them directly contrary to God's commandment? so in the 1 <hi>of Timothy:</hi> 2 <hi>chap:</hi> 11. <hi>and</hi> 12: <hi>verses:</hi> And let the women learne in silence with all subjection; But I suffer not a woman to teach or usurpe authority over the man, but to be in silence; then shewes that by the Creation, this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and subjection of the woman to the man was to be observed; and a woman not to usurpe authority to become a teacher pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and preach to men, a most impudent and shamefull thing as the Apostle termes it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. This is so apparent in those two Texts of Scripture, that they know not what to say to it, yet some would find out the most ridiculous shift that may be, to avoid this direct command, that is, that the Apostle doth not in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mean a woman, but the weaknesse of man, which he cals a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, can any man look upon such an answer to the places, but with contempt, that meanes not to be wilfully ignorant? when was the weaknesse of man maried, that it might aske her husband at home what shee would Learne? and in the other place that the Apostle meanes man and woman, is apparent, comparing them to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>

                        <hi>Answer.</hi> Thou falsly accuseth the servants of God, &amp; speaks wrong of our principles, and thou must use other Meanes, then such as thou hast used, if thou draw any from Errors, Is such other Meanes as thou hast used, like to draw people from Error? thou must first be drawn from it thy selfe, and come to Repentance and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake unrighteousnesse, pride and other sinnes, and know the beam pulled out of thy own Eye, before thou draw others from Error, And it is such, that live in wickednesse and deceit, that heapes up
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63974:17"/> teachers having Itching eares; And that is turned back upon thee, and thy Generation, that, are one with thee.</p>
                     <p>And for thy saying, that the devill winds and turnes every way to deceive; And sayst, at first hee Indeavoured to Carry on all in a Ranting way, knowing, that if Men believe they may injoy their lusts, and yet goe to heaven, and be in no fear of hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this would please the Multitude, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> Thou said at first, the devill began with that Trick of quakeing, And now thou saist, At first, he indeavoured to cary on all in a Ranting way, And so thou shewes thy winding and turning, to speak any false accusation against the Lord's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for its well known to those that fear the Lord, that there is a vast difference between these; And wee doe not own such wicked principles, but beare witnesse against them; It may be said upon a better account, that such things, are more like thy principles. (Considering thy wayes, words and actions) that Men might live in their lusts, and have their lusts satisfied, and yet think to Enjoy heaven; for wee own no such thing, but beare witnesse against lustfull wayes, and workes of darknesse, against such Ranting and wicked principles; And for thy bringing them in against us, it shewes but thy envy, or Ignorance, if not both: For if thou knew us, as in this particular, thou Could have no Just Ground, to lay such things to our Charge, or Reckon them upon our account; And therefore being Cleare of it, and seeing thy lyes, wee turne it back into the old Channel, and let it rest with the false accuser, which is one of the Markes the Apostles speaks of, 2 <hi>Epistle of Tim:</hi> 3. <hi>chap:</hi> where the deceivers are Marked, and the Children of the Lord sees them, and turnes away from them.</p>
                     <p>Thou saiest the Cunning Serpent turnes himselfe into another shape and puts on a shew of Mortification, &amp;c: only in volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humility (sayst thou) and what was their humility, In not wearing band-strings, nor Hat-bands, nor lace on their apparrell, nor Cuffes, and such like fooleries; And this, thou sayst the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Cals voluntary humility, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. <hi>last verse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> Wee Charge thee in this also, to be a false accuser, and a wrester of the Scripture, for doth the Apostle, there, speak of such things, as thou dost here Mention? And why dost thou
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63974:17"/> accuse us, for Casting off that, which thou Cals fooleries, if it were true in this particular, which thou saist; And why dost thou uphold and use that, which is but foollrie? Read and Consider thy folly, and see if thou be not puffed up in thy fleshly Mind, vainly upholding that which perisheth with the using, after the doctrine of Men; And for the begging Friars, which thou tels on, and the papistical worshipers, these are but thy slanders, which thou would Cast among the people, against the servants of the Lord; What because begging Friers, that shewed much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, were in deceit, and led by the wicked one, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others, that are lowly, and shew humility, in deceit? Nay <hi>William,</hi> thou art quite out; Let the begging Friars appeare how ever they Can the servants of the Lord are lowly and humble, and Cast off and beare witnesse against the unfaithfull workes of darknesse.</p>
                     <p>But sayst thou <hi>pag.</hi> 5: the devill Now, In this second designe of his, is Carrying on the quakers, and to that End, it is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, hee hath, and still doth imploy many Jesuites and Priests amongst them, who under Counterfeit Names and professions, Mingle themselves with them, and become their teachers, and Instructers, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> Wee say, thou Manifests thy selfe, who it is that carries on thee, and thy envy; to over-run thy understanding; and yet it may bee, thou thinks thy selfe, or would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a wise man, heare Now thou shall be put to it; Either to prove what thou hast spoken, or manifest thy selfe, that thou speaks beyond thy knowledge, thou saist its manifest, hee hath, and still doth imploy, Many Jesuits, &amp;c: amongst them; Now if it be not manifest then thou are manifest to bee what is said of thee (to wit) a false accuser, and thy wickednesse will turne upon thy own head; but if it be manifest and thou Conceale it, and doe not discover such, then thou art Guilty of Concealing such, as by the law are accounted traitours, and so art a transgressor of the law, in such Cases provided, Now try thy selfe; and it will be seen where the Counterfeit profession is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Thou sayst, I shall a little discover the way and Manner of the devils Carrying on of this delusion from the beginning, that the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63974:18"/> Madnesse thereof may appeare, &amp;c: the first rise of it, was from the North, And from thence as a plague, it spred it selfe over the greatest part of the kingdome, &amp;c: And the divel found out a new baite; that Ignorant people would easily be taken with, that they may yeild themselves to none, but think themselves as Good as the best, thinking there were no superiority, or inferiority amongst Men, and so Cast the fifth Commandment out of the Tables, and under pretence of Religion carrying on a levelling principle, &amp;c: Oh how did this take with the vulgar sort, that they might be under No rule, no Reverence, Either to Magistrate or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Parent or Master, but as beasts or worse be guided by the spirit, that is, the devils Impulses and delusions? &amp;c.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> Thou Manifests and discovers the Manner of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of wickednesse, in Carrying on of thee, from the beginning of thy paper, And thy folly doth appeare in such things which are false and slanderous; for wee may say here are a heap of lyes, and shall be turned back to the founder, untill it be proved, for wee own Magistrates, and Ministers, Parents and Masters, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates that doe justly, and Rule for God, and are a terrour to evill doers, Ministers that are sent of God, Children to obey their Parents in the Lord, And Servants to be obedient to their own Masters, in that which is right and just according to the Scripture; And thy slanders, wee much matter not, and the Sonnes of God are led by the Spirit of God, And the devils Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses and delusions, are thy own, from whence all this filth comes, out of the unclean bottle, but the truth is over it, and over all Lyars and Slanderers, And the Lord is the shield of his people, and in him doe we rejoyce, who is our Rock and strong tower, where we are safe; and thy poysned Arrowes are driven back, and the fruit of thy own doings must thou reap, and be filled with thy own devices.</p>
                     <p>In the 7th <hi>pag.</hi> thou sayest, <hi>Fox</hi> by one device he used, to draw a Gentlewoman, Made it manifest that hee used witch-craft; for presenting to her a bracelet, and desiring that shee would weare it for his sake; after shee had it, was Importunate with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that shee may goe and heare that holy man <hi>Fox:</hi> And thou goes on telling, that her husband said, hee would goe with her,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63974:18"/> and that hee knew of the bracelet, and desired to make tryall of it, whether it was witchery, And that shee took it from her Arme, and then her Mind changed, and desired to goe back, And that hee made further tryall of it, and put it upon one of their Maids, shee presently was Mad to run to their Meetings, and then hee put it on his own Arme, And found himselfe beginning to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with a desire, to goe to <hi>Fox:</hi> and then hee threw the brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in the fire, Not doubting but there was witchcraft in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, And this thou sayest, thou hast heard, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath affirmed and will make Good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> This wee doe Call also a heap of lyes; for no such thing, could yet be proved or Made Good, though it have been reported, and thou and others, who loves any thing that you think, makes against the Men of your Anger, are Ready to spred false reports abroad, but yet wee are willing, that this should be tryed, And wee will put thee to prove it, and make it appeare, or else the slander will rest upon thy head, thou having sent such things abroad; Name the Gentle-man, and the Gentle-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thou tels on, and the Maid, and where, and of what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they are, that people may know, if there be any such, where to find them, or else truly <hi>William,</hi> thou may be ashamed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe or report such lies, especially they being of so great a Concernment, and such a high Charge, as witchcraft and witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And if thy Judgment concerning us, Called quakers, be grounded upon such stuffe as this, thou art farre out of the way, And its like now these things being turned back to thee to prove, thou may see by Experience, that its easier for thee to Report many lyes, than to prove, or Cleare thy selfe, from those which thou hast sent forth already, but we rest in peace, whilest the wicked are snared in the worke of their own hands.</p>
                     <p>Thou sayst <hi>pag.</hi> 8. How that in the beginning it was Carried on by witchcraft, and many possessed with devils, is apparent, &amp;c: And bids read Mr <hi>Farmers</hi> book, a Minister of <hi>Bristol,</hi> thou Cals him, And then sayst after, that pratling woman <hi>Audlar</hi> Came to <hi>Banbury,</hi> what was done and practised, Not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men and Women, but upon Children, falling down, fomeing at the mouth, quakeing, and using unnaturall Gestures, as the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63974:19"/> Child that was possest with the devill, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> That it was carryed on by witchcraft, And many possessed with devils; is apparent to be thy lies, and this we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with the rest to the founder of them, and let them stand upon thy account, <hi>William,</hi> untill thou can bring better proofe than is yet apparent, As for <hi>Ralph Farmers</hi> book, it is answered, and hee proved to be a lyar, and a Minister of unrighteousnesse, and for all that you, one of you help another all you Can, by raising and reporting lyes, and others goes about to prove their lyes, by the lyes which others have raised, reported or printed; yet yee doe but all strive in vaine, the Lord prospers his worke, and cleares the Innocent, and wipes off your reproaches, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the Eyes of Many to see your refuge, which is but lyes, and your deceit, under which you would hide your selves; And for that woman, if thou Mean <hi>Anne Audland,</hi> is well known unto many who feare the Lord, how wickedly and unjustly shee was persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Imprisoned at <hi>Banbury,</hi> Contrary to Righteousnesse and Equity, and was falsly accused by many, and thou helps one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest; but shee walked at <hi>Banbury,</hi> as a Good Example in the feare of the Lord, and the power and the presence of the Lord was with her, and many knew the power of God manifest, which Caused trembling and quakeing, of which wee are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, though thou revile it, and tell of foaming at the Mouth, and of the Child that was possest, those are thy slanders, and rests for some of thy lyes; but was not some that persecuted her, and others of the Servants of the Lord, there made to tremble, and struck downe with a witnesse; Its good for thee and them at <hi>Banbury,</hi> who had a hand in opposing the power of God, as Many of you, as have yet time to Repent of your Evill wayes, and returne unto the Lord, Lest the stroke come upon you, which may be grievous and terrible, and no hiding place found.</p>
                     <p>But thou sayst; Now the devill perceiving, that it begins to be suspected, to bee, either possession, witchcraft, or cheating tricks, as I think there was all of them in the practise, hee leaves it off, and we heare no more of it, Lest he should be discovered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> So then, if all be true that thou sayst, the devill, hath left off witchcraft, possessing of people, and cheating tricks, then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63974:19"/> then thou may leave off persecuting the divell, as thou said before; but this is false also, for the devill is as farre from leaving his chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tricks, as thou art from leaving thy lyes and slanders, And by such stuffe as this, thou discovers thy selfe: And for that which thou doest slander, the power of the Lord God is manifested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his people, and his precious presence, for hee leaves not them who feare him, blessed be his name for evermore.</p>
                     <p>And for thy speaking of <hi>James Naylor,</hi> that which hee did which was contrary to the truth, was not owned by them, who abide in the truth; but yet Many things which are spoken of him, are false, yet what as was amisse in any particular, wee doe not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify, and several things which thou speaks of him, are false; for it could not be proved, that ever we know, that hee ever said, hee was as Just, holy, and Good as God, Neither did wee ever own him, for our chiefest Doctor and teacher, as thou saist, they are thy lyes, Cast against the servants of the Lord, to make truth odious, but the truth Raignes over your heads, and the Lord preserves them who waites upon him, and gathers many out of the by-wayes, and brings them into his fold, to know the Lord alone to be their teacher and Chief Shepheard.</p>
                     <p>Thou sayst thou shalt proceed, to speak something of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and practises, that every sober Man might Consider how Contrary they are to the word of God which word, thou sayst, is sure and endureth for ever, and is given of God to be a light unto our feet, but sayst thou, the devils cheif aime &amp; end is to make them Cast away this word of truth, as a dead letter, &amp;c: and then teach them to be led by the spirit within them, and then sayst, when hee have brought them to this, hee hath fitted them for all his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delusions; And then tels of <hi>Feltons</hi> stabbing the <hi>Duke of Buckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham,</hi> And one being met with a Cord about his middle &amp; said the spirit had sent him to hang such a Minister, &amp;c: and of a base Trul, thou tels on going to a mans bed, and of a maid that was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to filthinesse, and left them, and told a godly minister, And then sayst thou, observe what this Doctrine of theirs produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth when they must goe according to the spirit within them, and lay aside the word of God, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> Wee say to thee, that instead of speaking our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63974:20"/> which we own, and are taught, thou proceeds to speak forth thy own lyes, and filthiness, by which all sober Men, who feare the Lord and sees thy lyes, may Consider, how Contrary thou art to the word of God, and to all righteousnesse, being as one given up to believe lyes, and to follow strong delusions, and to utter forth thy wickedness so Impudently and arrogantly, as if thou should never be called to an account, for if thou had not set thy heart to Mischiefe, and bent thy tongue like a bow for lyes, thou would blush, that Ever such abominable, loathsome detestable wickednesse, should be sent forth by thee; which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wayes, wee deny from our hearts, yet wee are willing to be tryed, as to these things: if thou can prove that wee own such filthyness as is Mentioned, doe it, or else they shall rest as thy lyes, Name the Man, with Cord thou tels on, and the Minister, and the Maid, and the other Godly Minister thou speaks of, that people may know where to inquire, and Cease slandering, for wee own no such things, and wee have not cast the word of God aside, wee own it to be a light to our feet according to the Scripture; And wee own the word of truth thou hast quite mist our doctrine, and hast uttered forth thy own filthy broath, out of thy polluted vessel; And this wee declare also, that wee own the spirit within, (to wit) the spirit of truth, which leads into all truth; but the spirit of God leads not into such wayes, as thou tels on, for such things come from the uncleane spirit, but as thou hast laid the Charge, wee may say, they come from thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heart, that thou might cast forth thy venome against the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, who are guided by the spirit of truth, and likewise to perswade people, that the doctrine were false, which directs to be led by the spirit within; Now wee say, what ever any be led unto, which is evill, who follow the Counsell of their own hearts, that is from the evill spirit, yet that doth not make voide the leadings of the spirit of truth▪ what because theirs a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked spirit, must therefore people follow no spirit, that is not sound? <hi>William;</hi> for if any man have not the spirit of Christ, hee is none of his, and none knowes the things of God truly and rightly, but by the spirit of God, nor none can understand the scriptures of truth, truly, or know the things that are there spoken of saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63974:20"/> but by the spirit of God, which leads and guides into all truth, and reveales the deep things of God, and this is our doctrine, as hath often been declared; And they who are honest hearted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and know it, and wee own the spirit of truth, and scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture also, and knowes that holy men speak as they were Moved by the holy Ghost; And so thy lyes we returne upon thy own head, and there let them rest, Except thou repent, All thy height and Glory and wisdome of the world, will not free thee from the Condemnation, which comes Justly from the Lord upon them who loves and makes lyes, and such cannot enter into God's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Remember that, And therefore Repent whilest thou hast time, this is love to thy soule, and plaine dealing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Thou sayst, <hi>pag.</hi> 13: another doctrine of theirs is, that they are perfect, and without any sinne, and sayst many have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, as old <hi>Hix</hi> told mee <hi>Simon Tomson</hi> did, and this thou goes about to Confute, and make much adoe about it, for there are three or foure pages, and sayst it tends to Ranting, that nothing they doe is sinne, except they think it so, and sayst there is a twofold Clensing of sinne, one is of the Guilt of sinne, and in that way, thou saist, sinne is not Imputed, the other is the power and operation of sinne in your Mortall bodies, while you live here, &amp;c: and that is not taken away, &amp;c: And thou sayst, they Cast off prayer, alltogether, in respect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Answ: That many of us have pleaded, that we were perfect and without any sinne, remaines for thee to prove; for old <hi>Hix</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that he told thee so of <hi>Simon Tomson,</hi> neither doe we say, that nothing which a man doth is sinne, except he think it so; for we say according to the Scripture, that all unrighteousnesse is sinne, and thy principle is more like ranting? that the power and operation of sinne, must be in your mortall bodies while you live, and yet no guilt, is not this ranting? commit sinne, while you live, yea the power of it, and operation in you, and yet not guilty nor condemned? be not deceived, he that commits sinne is a servant of sinne, and such are free far righteousnesse, and the wages of sinne is death; and so thou speaks many things, in thy own imagination, raising things of thy own, and then figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63974:21"/> with them, wherein thou dost but make worke for thy selfe, beating the aire, and when thou hast raised lies, and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth thy own inventions, thou shewes thy skill to confute them; for that is, an absolute lye, with many more, that thou hast set down, that we deny prayer altogether; as in respect of our selves; And as touching perfection, we own it, according to the Scripture, and do presse on after the marke, which is before, and let as many as are perfect, be thus minded: the Apostle laboured, that he might present men perfect in Christ Jesus, and He spoke wisdome amongst them who were perfect, but not the wisdome of the World, but the wisdome of God, and so we doe own, that people should presse after perfection, and say also, that some doe come to a perfect man in Christ Jesus; but we never said, that what ever a man doe, it is not sinne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he think it so, and therefore people are perfect and have no sinne, because they account nothing sinne, but what they think may be so; for we declare of that, which will measure truely, and reprove people, and judge them for unrighteousnesse, and we say people must come to Repentance and Conversion, and know a change from the waies of the world and from the works of darknesse, and be turned to the light, which makes manifest those things that are to be reproved, and he that confesseth his sinne, and comes truely to repentance, comes to know remission of sins, and the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse from all sinne, which thou dost not yet know, as by thy own words, are manifest; for if the power and operation of sinne, is, and must be in thy mortall bodie as long as thou lives, then the lamb of God, thou knowes not yet to have taken away thy sinne, nor the cleansing, nor belike, never expects it, as long as thou lives; sinne in its power and operation, must be in thee whil'st thou lives, and yet no guilt, Is not this the way to let in all filthinesse, and the ranting principle thou told of, that men may live as they list, and enjoy their lusts while they live, and think to enjoy Heaven, and be cleansed when they are dead, and no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth not this Doctrine please the multitude, proud men, covetous men, hypocrites, and deceitfull workers, they may live in sinne, and sinne in them, and that in its power, as long as they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63974:21"/> live, (and yet the guilt is taken away) and they believe it shall never be otherwise, but shall live in sinne, as long as they are here; and if any own the way of God, which is pure, and be borne of the seed immortall, and presse after perfection, and own it to be attainab e, in Christ Jesus, Oh such are of a ranting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, say the proud and covetous, the lyars, and dissembling hypocrites, of which number thou art found to be; for though the Scripture say, he that is borne of God, doth not commit sinne, yet thou sayst, they may, or doe commit sinne, whereby thou shewes thy ignorance, that thou knowes not the borne of God, yet saith thou the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sinne, but its like, thou looks for no such thing; while thou lives, sinne must live, and have its operation in thee, in power, as long as thou art here, tell thee of owning perfection, or the borne of God, that is not for thy purpose, they are deluders in thy account, but thou art farre enough from that, and like to be, it seemes, as long as thou lives; where is the place or, where is the time of cleansing, no uncleane thing enters into Gods Kingdome; and thou lives in sinne, and it in thee in power as long as thou lives; now what place between these, is for the cleansing, and what time? art thou not Papisticall, of the opinion of the Friars and Priests, thou told of, for a purgatory; but the Saints knew cleansing, and that which made them free, and gave them victory, and this we tell thee plainly, if thou live in sinne, and die in sinne, and the power of it, and operation of it, in thee, thou must know condemnation, and therefore repent, and take heed of hardening thy heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the way of the Lord, and cease from thy lying, for the righteousnesse of God will be revealed from Heaven, against all unrighteousnesse of men.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63974:22"/> old time, Christ saith sweare not at all; and all is commanded to heare him whatsoever he saith, he is the true and faithfull witnesse; And <hi>James</hi> a good witnesse of the Doctrine of Christ, saith above all things, sweare not by Heaven, or Earth, or any other oath, Now sayst thou, can any imagine, that Christ would interpret, his law in this place otherwise, then stands with his own command in other places? we say there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which were commanded, which had their time, and then ceased, and the Scripture saith, there is verily a disanulling of the Commandement going before, for the weaknesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitablenesse thereof, for the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18, 19. Now thou may see, some Commandements was disanulled, and many things [as the priesthood] which was commanded, the priesthood was changed, &amp; Circumcision which was a command, and other things which had their time &amp; was fulfilled, &amp; now its neither Circumcision nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision but a new creature, And so concerning swearing, Christ said, it was said of old time performe thy oaths; but I say unto you, swar not at all, &amp; Christs Doctrine, we do own, &amp; denies thy delusion.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63974:29"/> a very persecuter of the power of Godliness, and a bad Example (in the City of <hi>Bristol</hi>) of pride, envy, lying, and hypocrisy, and his wayes are taken notice of, and some of his unjustness, lyes, slanders, and unrighteousness is Recorded, and will appeare to Generations to come; And indeed hee is so taken notice of, and his filthiness hath so appeared, that Generally throughout that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the honest Godly people deny him, and sees him to be a very formal, time-serving dissembling hypocrite; yea, many people that are not called quakers in that City, discernes him to be a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worker; one man that is in that City, accounted a Minister, and doth preach at the steeple houses in <hi>Bristol</hi> weekly, writ some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of late concerning <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> and said, that hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon his writing, to bee, (speaking of his derisions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, untruths and Jeering,) better becoming the mouth of a stage-player, than the pen of a Minister, (and said farther) hee looked upon it as the fruits of a frothy braine, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of a splenish temper, rather than a of Minister of Christ, and said (moreover) that much of Englands misery (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of <hi>Bristols</hi>) was an Ignorant, ungodly, lazy, proud, scandalous soul murthering ministry, which have made themselves contemptible in the eyes of all good men, and in the consciences of many bad, one of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said thus of <hi>Ralph Farmer;</hi> this witness is true, and yet this mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts must be brought by thee, to confirme thine; hee would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a shame to thee (Man,) if thou knew him well, as hee is, than a help to thee, to have him on thy side; for thou couldst scarce a chused out a worse out of the whole Troop, which mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the way by consent, and commit lewdness; But his book is answered, and his folly made manifest; And though thou Joyne thy selfe with such, and lick up the very filth, and froth that is poured out of their unclean botles; yet it is all to no purpose, you cannot prevaile with all your weapons, and that is to your great greif and sorrow; the Corner-stone is over your heads, and the feet of the Saints is on the top of your highest places; And though one of you, bring in anothers lyes to confirme your own; yet all your Arrowes, will returne into your own bowels, and all your bowes must be broken, &amp; <hi>Josephs</hi> bow abides in strength,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63974:30"/> and the meek of the earth rejoyce in the Lord, and magnify the God of their salvation. Thou saist, they that will read that book, may find what thou hast laid down confirmed, and divers other practises of Satan, to abuse these people manifested, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions held which is horrid and damnable. Wee say there is, both in what thou hast laid down, and also in <hi>Ralph Farmers</hi> booke, divers practises of Satan, to abuse us, manifested, and opinions held, both in thy paper and his book, which are horrid and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; therefore it's time for you to cease such practises of Satan, by which you abuse us, for by such are you manifested, and they who reades with understanding in the feare of the Lord, may see your folly; And now that thou should confess, that what thou lays down, and also other practises of Satan's in that booke, are manifested to abuse us; Is it not time for thee to give over such practises, and to deny such a book which confirmes them to abuse us, and to Repent of what thou hast done against the truth already, and against the servants of the Lord? for truly the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cannot stand in Judgment. No oppressors, deceitfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, dissembling hypocrites, abusers of the servants of the Lord, nor Cruell hard harted ones, can stand in the terrible day, which will come upon all workers of Iniquity, when the Lamb of God comes to Judgment, to reward to every one according to their deeds, then such as have been persecuted and hated, and evill spoken of, because they followed the Lamb, shall rejoyce; and the Lords adversaries shall be broken to peeces, out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will hee thunder upon them, and there will be no hiding place found, for the workers of Iniquity to cover them from the wrath of the Lamb; Great men and mighty men, at that time, who are found enemies to the pure wayes of the Lord cannot es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the edge of the sword; All the Titles of honor and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor all the worlds Glory, will not hide from the Just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Almighty, he will come upon the wicked in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and vex them in his sore displeasure; Therefore be thou war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the fear of the Lord, to repent, and returne from the way of wickedness, And Cease slandering, and abusing them, who fear the Lord and tremble at his word, and prize thy time, that thou may know the things, that concernes the satisfaction
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63974:30"/> and peace of thy soule, wee desire, in the will of the Lord, that it may be so, And therefore wee doe not flatter thee, for wee may not give flattering Titles unto Man, but wee deale plainly with thee, and in the feare of the Lord warne thee, therefore Consider, <hi>William,</hi> what will all the Glory and dignity of the world doe for thee, if thou goe with thy Gray head, Laden with sinne unto the Grave?</p>

This man what ever he be it matters not, (for what he writes sheweth, who set him on work) begins with magnifying the great and glorious work of God at this time, with high expressions, many drawn out of Scripture, and all most falsly applied; for his meaning is, the gathering together of these Quakers, and sending them up and downe in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is, this which he cals the <hi>opening of the eyes of the blind,</hi> the <hi>making known the way of peace and rest,</hi> and many other expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons applied to set forth this great work of admiration in his eyes, as he would have his disciples believe; The man puts darkness for light, here as in many other things, for it is true indeed that the power of God hath herein appeared, and that he hath visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this nation, but in judgment and in great displeasure in this particular, and that in an high degree, not in <hi>Loving kindness and in mercy,</hi> as this man would have his deceived simple people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they may be carried on still in their errors. God being provoked by us a sinful nation, that having the truth of the Gospel clearly manifested unto us, and preached amongst us, as no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christendome hath had the like, yet insteed of opening our eyes, and imbraceing the truth in the love of it, we have shut our eyes against it, and delighted in unrighteousness, and selfe-seeking, and (which is worst of all) for our own ends covered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with God's garment, pretending the care of religion, when it was to carry on mens designes and set up themselves, this is that which God hath been provoked by, and still is, and therefore in his just judgment he hath let loose that great red Dragon, that old serpent the Devill (which deceives the world) to deceive this people, and lead them into damnable errors to their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and let it be observed that this came not to pass, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

For what he saith I have written against the servants of God that tremble at his word, and against the way they walke in, which I cannot prove, that shall appeare when he comes to charge me with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; and then it shall be seen who is a lyer, a slanderer, and an arrogant false accuser; my heart desires that those he so often names, the servants of the Lord, and that tremble at his word, did know what it is to serve the Lord, for stareing and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unnaturall and unseemly gestures of the body are not to be accounted trembling at his word, nor never in the Scripture were so named or esteemed.</p>
                  <p>In the first <hi>Page,</hi> he saith there are severall lyes as in all the rest, and then using swelling words of vanity (as their custome is) not coming to particulars, at last he sayth some of them may be spoken to, &amp; after some reviling language, begineth with this, that it's said <hi>the seduced people whom they call Quakers not without cause, because the Divel began first with them with that trick of his, to make the people think there was something extraordinary in it;</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers this is false, and thou art not only a false accuser of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63974:34"/> people of God, (as he alwaies cals his Quakers,) but an accuser of the power of God; as if this disorderly and shamefull carriage of theirs, were wrought in them by the power of God, to make them tremble at his word, desiring so to Cloak it and cover it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; Then <hi>William</hi> must beare all their railing language, which the holy Angels would not give to Devils, that it may thereby appeare from what spirit it comes; <hi>There was one Simon Magus in the City of Samaria, that for a long time used sorceries, and bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the people, whereupon they said, this is the great power of God,</hi> so these deluded people (as those poore people then were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till by the preaching of <hi>Philip</hi> they were reduced from their error) say this witchery, and possession of the Divell is the great power of God, and so <hi>their Simon Magus</hi> amongst them carries them on in these sad delusions; I wish with all my heart, the Lord would please to open their eares, and send a <hi>Philip</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, by whome they might be delivered from these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises, slights, and sorceries of Sathan. Now to come to the thing it selfe, that in the beginning and the first rise of these Quakers, the Devill was let loose in God's just judgment upon the nation, and did possess some of them, and that witchery and sorceries was used amongst them,<note place="margin">Two wayes made appeare, that Quakers have been posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and used witcheries.</note> will be made apparent even by the confession of the men themselves who had been possessed by the Divels, and by the witcheries used: for the first read that which is set down of <hi>John Gilpin</hi> possessed, and you have his own confession of it, and this attested by the Mayor, Minister, School-master, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Town of Kendal; there was another, a servant (I take it) to one of London, who set down the same, of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing possessed by the Devill amongst these Quakers, and in going to their meetings, and what strange things the Divell did in him, and by him, and this he sets forth (a book of himselfe) which book I have seen. Then for witchery, and dealing with familiar spirits, read that of <hi>Spencer</hi> related by Mr <hi>Farmer,</hi> and it is by the mans own confession, read also in Mr Farmer, that of John Gilpin, but you raile upon Mr Farmer, read then in Mr Samuel Clarke, Pastor of Benet Finke in London, in him and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, I believe any rational man may read and see evidently proved these particulars and many more, that will evidence this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63974:35"/> to be a truth, and that of <hi>Foxes</hi> witchery by his bracelet, the Gentleman is likely to stop your mouthes by his proving of it; Let reasonable and understanding men but consider the thing it selfe, and the manner of acting of it, and it will clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare not to proceed from the holy spirit of God; but from that uncleane and impure spirit, for as was evident by some that came out of the north into Wales to Wrexham, besides their most false doctrines, that they were perfect and without sin; and doctrines of Arminians; universal redemption, free will, falling from grace, that all men had the seed of God in them, and that at the first look they could know a hypocrite from a Saint; and such like falshoods, which are usual with them; when they meet together, and had sate a good while silent, then one or more would fall down with such a terrifying quakeing, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in all their bodies and joints, with such strange swellings in their bellies and bowels, such screeking and howlling, and so loud, that not only those present were terrified, but the very dogges barked at it, and swine cryed; is this likely to come from the spirit and power of God? or to be (as you would cloake it) a trembling at his word? when they sate silent and heard no word at all before this divellish device began; nay more than this, it is said that in this theire quakeing fits, (besides the distorted po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of their bodies &amp; Limbes,) the uncleane spirit (for such unseemly and brutish actions could proceed from no other, no not from man himselfe, being himselfe) made them when they lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground to purge upward and downward most shamefully. Would any (but such as you are) own such things to come from God's spirit? the like was never heard on in Scripture, but for Scripture you care little, and for your shift to cover such unhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions and gestures withall, by calling it a trembling at God's word, it is done when no word is spoken, done by chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that the word works not upon; as I have hard of a child of <hi>Wagstaffes in Banbury</hi> (as I remember) who lay in this manner till your meeting was done, and your Good-wife <hi>Alder</hi> was faine to come and blow in his eare, before he could be raised, if that be true, I believe there was witchery in it; and again if it were from God to cause trembling at his word, why doth it not still
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63974:35"/> continue? how comes the feare of his word and the reverence thereof to cease now and be laid aside? no it is clear enough it was (as I said) a trick of the Divel, which was so shameful, that he was afraid to continue it, est it should discover him, and so hinder the carrying on of his delusions; I have been the longer herein, to discover your falshood, and how falsely you raile u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me for this, and especially that others may see the Devils work in it.</p>
                  <p>In the next place you would answer your railings upon me, as a persecuter, a whited wall, a painted sepulchre, one that keeps drunkards and swearers in my house, these be fine railing termes, but sutable to your dialect, and you deny none of them, but Justify them, which when I shall prove to be most false, then whether you be railers or no will appeare, and such are not the the servants of God, what ever you will call your selves, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that is your folly that you appropriate that name, [the servants of God] only to your selves; but know that no railer shall enter into the kingdome of God, I wish therefore that you may be convinced of it, repent for it, and leave it; that I am a perseccutor, you say, I have manifested already, that I am sure you can never prove; but your way is this to take any thing that will serve your turne, and make that a proof though never so false; If I doe that which is right and just, if others in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it, shall slight and oppose authority, if they suffer for it, whose fault is that? It is in justice and truth to be laid to their own charge, this being cleare I will come to the particular which you mention in generall, and so you may say any thing, and no man understand whether it be true or false, and that's your way to asperse men withall, I hope I shall through the grace of God given me, for Christ's sake alwaies continue to profess and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, that which the Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> exhorteth unto, <hi>earnestly to contend for the faith once delivered unto the Saints, by Christ and his Apostles;</hi> especially when we find such men creeping in amongst us; and this was it that made me not willing to seeme to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny countenance unto them, and their wayes and doctrine, which directly oppose that faith once delivered unto the Saints by the Scriptures (as I have shewed) and therefore when they living
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63974:36"/> in my towne and my houses, which by right they could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doe then I pleased, and withall going about to set up mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that their false teachers might have opportunity to seduce them more, and draw in others to them, and appointing their meetings in the night about ten of the Clock, to the disturbance of the rest of the Towne, and a thing of evill report, and of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity given to Sathan for his temptations, as I have formerly shewed, and therefore forbidden, and by the customes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as is well known) not to be suffered, I hereupon gave them warning that they should provide for themselves else where, for they should not continue longer in my Towne nor in my houses; also because they would keep their unseasonable meetings, at such times contrary to the Law, as the Bell ringing at 8 of the clock sheweth; I desired a Justice of the Peace to call them before him, and to restraine them from that disorderly course in the Towne, they coming to appeare before him, shewed no respect as to a Magistrate, which is their Custome, and when he required them to give security to appeare at the Sessions, they would not doe it, but absolutely refused, whereupon they were sent to the Goale, as any man upon such refusall is to be; this was <hi>Potter</hi> and <hi>Tompson,</hi> now <hi>Goodman railer,</hi> who persecuted these men? If any man will commit a fault, and when he hath done, stout it out against the Magistrates, before whom he is brought, and therefore be sent to the Goale by the Magistrate, is he that accuseth him, or witnesseth the truth against him, to be called a persecutor? and for putting them out of my houses, had there not been so just an occasion to move me to doe it, as they gave me, yet may I not doe with mine own what I think best? giving them time enough to provide themselves, and <hi>Tompson</hi> was bound in a bond (which I have) to leave the house when his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died, being but a part and peice of that Cottage which his mother had, and which with the rest his brother now hath, being but one Cottage, and here who would not laugh at the foolery which he sets down? That I for my profit lay hous to house, this was the same house and a new erected Cottage which ought to be pulled down, but I laid it to the same whereof it was a peice before, and that to my disprofit, if I would have taken
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63974:36"/> rent for it, as I might, the houses are let as they were before else it were not a disprofit to me, but to men that will serve God with me; Then he saith, I brake my promise, which is most false, I think he speaks of <hi>Woodfield</hi> the Miller, a weak man alwaies, and easily deluded, but (I hope) honest according to his knowledg, I heartily wish he would harken to found Doctrine, and be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the word of God rightly expounded unto him; I never made other promise unto him, but that if he would continue to me such a servant as he was, I never intended to put him away, and it was my intention; but when his wife who was one that followed <hi>Cop</hi> formerly had drawn him to these fancies (which he at first desired me to draw her off from) then he cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I told him, that if he would not serve God with me in his publick worship, it was not fit for me to keep him my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, he said, I would not make him goe against his conscience; I told him suppose his conscience should be to goe to the Masse, and worship Images, and turne a Papist, would it be fit for me to keep him my servant? He answered he would die rather then doe so; I answered my conscience was cleare he ought no more to refuse the worship of God, which he did now refuse, and therefore if he would not worship God with me, he must not be my servant, which if he would have continued as he was he should have been, and other promise I never made him; and whereas this fellow saith, I did it because he would not yeild to my pride in putting off his hat to me, it is no newes to see them lie, if you looke over all his railings, for this is such a lie, that <hi>Woodfeild</hi> after he was gone (coming to me upon some occasion) did use that civility which these men that turne themselves into beasts will not doe, which I care no more for, then to see a Bull or an Oxe to goe by me with his hornes upon his head, onely I confesse it grieves me for their sakes, to see how the Devill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes them to draw them to cast off humanity.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the two last, who were (as this fellow saith) persecuted, and one of them whipped; I take this pains and so far trouble my selfe to satisfy others of the truth of things; for these railers doe not mean to be satisfied, though truth be made apparent; I shall first shew what they did, and then what they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63974:37"/> suffered, and why, being one day in Newton feild, there was this <hi>Tompson</hi> and <hi>Knowles,</hi> and as I came by them, they would neither looke, nor shew any respect befitting men, thereupon I said unto them, will you be so uncivill as to carry your selves more like beasts then men? <hi>Tompson</hi> flies out presently into railing, and cals me, thou persecutor, and many such like termes and speeches he used; then the other standing by, I asked him, whether he would carry himselfe like a beast? he to my face said, thou liest, then which a greater provocation could not be given, My Sonne <hi>Richard Fines</hi> being neer, and seeing their insolency, and base carriage, went to <hi>Tompson,</hi> and pulling off his hat cast it upon the ground; whereupon he called him a thiefe and one that stole his goods, I was glad he let him alone, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged not himselfe upon him for his insolency; these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done by such kind of people, I thought it was fit some exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should be made of their insolent proud behaviour, that others might not be encouraged to doe the like, but rather heare and feare and not dare to grow to the like insolent behaviour; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I desired a Justice of the peace to heare it, and the proofes of it, and then to proceed according to the order made against provoking language to prevent Duels, which is, <hi>if any shall use such language except they acknowledg it and give satisfaction, they are to be sent to the house of correction,</hi> They were (these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved) required to give in band to appeare at the Sessions, they refused to doe so, and were sent to the Gaiole, when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions were, these things being proved, they were according to the Order, sent to the house of correction, fined a small fine, and enjoyned by the Order of the Bench to make their submission to me, and aske me forgivenesse, when they were at the house of correction they would not worke; the master told them if they would not worke they must be whipped, not for what they had done to me, but because they refused to work there, And that he must doe, thereupon <hi>Tompson</hi> at last obeyed the orders of the house, and was not medled with, but the other proud stubborn boy would not, and therefore was whipped, it was sufficient to me, that such intollerable pride and insolency should not be suffered, as if we lived under no Law or Government, but like a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63974:37"/> of beasts in a wildernesse, and this would have been an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, had it not been punished according to Law, to encourage every proud boy to grow insufferable: for their <hi>submission</hi> to me, and asking me <hi>forgivenesse,</hi> I sent to the Bench and desired they might not be kept in any longer, for that though they would not doe it, the making these insolent companions know that they, and their fellowes were under Authority was that which I (for example sake) looked after, now let goodman <hi>Quaker</hi> see where he will finde his persecutor, either his <hi>William Fines,</hi> or the Law, or the Justices of the Bench; I am the longer in laying open the truth of these matters of fact, that my neighbours that shall read his lies and slanders, and my answer, may see how little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is to be given to his high swelling railing discourse all along: for <hi>drunkards</hi> in my house he can say nothing but some have reeled: poore fellow! Who saw him? and who was it that reeled? here thou canst not reelethy selfe out of a lie; for <hi>swearers</hi> take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how ridiculous he makes himselfe: I keep swearers in my house, because my servants being called before a Magistrate to testifie the truth upon their Oathes, take an Oath, which they are both by God and man in such a case bound to doe; I have now shewed his railing, about persecution, his judgments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced which is usually with them as often as their railing spirit is stirrd; and I have shewed that there is no ground at all for it, more then to say, he is a persecutor that brings a man to be punished for what he deserves, and which by his own fault he brings upon his own head; for <hi>whited wall and painted sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,</hi> he will have that made good, and chargeth me with it, because I act and live contrary to my profession; he should prove that in some particulars; but for my walking according to the rule of Gods word, which the servants of God should keep themselves unto, and their casting that rule from them, that they may walke according to the light within them, and the voice and spirit within them, which (not tryed by the word) is nothing but their own fancies and the Divels delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this I will leave to the judgment of those who knowes us both, and our conversations, and that word of truth which shall judg us at the last day. Next he quarrels that I say, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63974:38"/> not them, <hi>but their pride, and other sinnes and the Divell therein;</hi> here he begins with railing as all along, and then thinks to get a great advantage by asking, whether the Divell was <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned?</hi> or <hi>whipped?</hi> ignorant or wilfull man! cannot it be said that the sinnes proceeding from the Devil are reproved and persecuted, when those men are reproved and persecuted, in and by whom he acts them? he might as well have taken this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, against what our blessed Saviour said, when he reproved the working of Sathan in <hi>Peter, get thee behind me Sathan,</hi> was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Sathan? was it Sathan that spoke to our Saviour? this he might as well aske, as was it Sathan that was whipped? here see the weakness or malice of the man; my desire was to shew that I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their pride &amp; insolency that came from Sathan, not their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which I would use meanes to bring out of Sathans power if I could: for <hi>Munster business,</hi> as in the rest, he doth think it enough to say it is false; but let any understanding man read it, as it is laid down in the 10th chapter of <hi>Sleyden,</hi> and he will see (as I have said) the principles the same; and were it in your power, the issue would be the same, when you have <hi>a John of Leiden</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you on; you goe by the spirit within you, by the voice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, by revelations and inspirations, as you will make them, and so did those people in Germany untill they were destroyed, and called themselves the servants of God as highly, and as much as you poore deluded people doe; when I express my desire to bring them from their error and delusions into the way of truth, that cannot be endured, then he railes upon me, which sheweth who they are that cannot endure wholsome doctrine, but <hi>heap up to themselves teachers</hi> that will not gainsay their lusts, but lead them on in them; now he would shew my winding and turning, but so foolishly and falsly, as any man may discover; for he would draw it out of this that now I said, at first the Devill began with rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but I said before, he began with the trick of Quaking, both is true, before these Quakers came in play, he carried on his divellish worke by Ranters; when he saw that grew odious, then he set up these Quakers, and with them began this trick of Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; what turning or winding is in this? your mouth may be stopped, now he seemes to be mightily offended, saying that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63974:38"/> I charge them with ranting, he shewes not what I said thereof, but like the old Dragon casts out a Sea of railing against me for false accusing, &amp; that I am a Ranter, &amp; such like, in my principles &amp; they beare witness against ranting; I wish they be not in the end drawn to their practises, when they own this, that, they are without sin; so that in the end nothing they do will be sin; &amp; therefore they may do any thing. That one false principle that they are without any sin, is likely to make way for the Devill to draw them on to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is all I have said, &amp; yet not in this place, but that you may see the Quakers and Ranters do not altogether disagree in their principles, &amp; therefore, it is to be feared they may at last concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together. In a book set forth by <hi>Fox</hi> &amp; <hi>Nayler</hi> their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prophets, called a word from the Lord, &amp; Printed 1654. <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. they speak a word to the Ranters, &amp; tell them that they had a puer convincement, so (it seems) they approve of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if they had keept to them; let these men take heed what this may come unto in the end, if they go upon the same principles.</p>
                  <p>Next he railes on me for shewing their Mortification to be no other then a vollutary humility, as the Apostle cals it, in the <hi>Coll.</hi> 2: not a humility commanded by God at all, but only coming from their own fancies, and therefore sets up the flesh, as the Apostle saith, comming from the flesh; and because I shew it to be a foolery, to place humility in not wearing band-strings, and and laces, and such like, which God never commanded to be laid aside to shew humility; therefore he ignorantly, (or purposely to serve his turne) will understand it, as if I intended it was a foolery to weare such things, when the meaning is, that they be, and all such things are fooleries, when the forbearing of the use of them is made a Testimony of humility and Mortification, when pride is thereby more shewed, than humility, as in the Popish begging Friars and Priests; his answer to this of their humility and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, shewed in laying aside such things, which indeed are fooleries, when made such a use of as to testify humility which God never appointed, and therefore of the Apostle Called <hi>will-worship comming from the fl sh,</hi> is very simple perverting what is spoken, to a clean contrary sense, that he might seeme to make an answer besides his railing; and because the begging Friars herein doe goe beyond them, he confesseth they shewed much humility, but in deceit he saith, and there is the same deceit
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63974:39"/> in this of theirs, for it is apparent by all their other cariages, that there is not a prouder generation amongst men, than they thereby shew themselves to be, this is true, let them raile, as he doth; if there did appeare in you a meek and quiet spirit, instead of your railings and judging men, which will bring Judgment u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon you, as, your Saviour saith when he forbids it, this would te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify your humility, and witness it much more, than your not weareing laces and band-strings, which is nothing but a foolery laughed at.</p>
                  <p>His railing, reviling, and false accusing, which is in every an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of his I leave, and cast away as the barkeing of a mad dogg, and I will come to the matter it selfe, whereby this false accusing will appeare; he saith, that I discovering the Divels car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of his designe by these Quakers, doe say that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest he makes use of many Jesuits and Priests, who under other formes and professions mingle themselves with them, and become their teachers; here the man would find out a devise to shew his wit, but thereby discovereth a kind of foolish devise to Cloak the business, which he doth not plainly deny, he saith if it be manifest, I must prove it, if I doe not prove it, then I conceale Traytors; I wish I could as easily catch them, and bring them forth, as I can prove it; Then it would quickly appeare I am no favourer of Jesuits and Popish Priests; it is easy to prove and make it manifest, that subtle foxes have crept into the flock, and destroy'd the Lambes, and done mischeife; but not so easy to take them, for when they have done that which they came for, they runne away, and hide themselves in their holes and dens, as these doe, returning beyond Sea to their Jesuiticall Collidges, or hiding themselves heare under some mecanick trade, (as hath been seen) untill they have opportunity again to carry on their work for which they are sent, I wish with all my heart the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates did more strictly search after them then they doe, for some that have come from beyond Sea doe say, there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come over to carry on this designe, that their Colledges are much emptied thereby; and he that shall read what the Jesuite <hi>Persons,</hi> and the rest of them resolved, and what <hi>Camponella</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised the King of Spaine, shall perceive what they think to be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63974:39"/> the only designe, to bring this Kingdome againe to their religion, that is, to take all advantages to breed, and carry on divisions, and distractions amongst us, and therefore they greatly imbrace this opportunity to increase, and carry on these simple people in their delusions to oppose Magistrasy, and Ministery, and all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Ordinances; calling them outward carnal formes, which are to be laid aside; this pleaseth these Jesuits very highly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when they may with all have opertunity (as they have) to leaven them with their own false doctrine by teaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; now to manifest that these doe mingle themselves, amongst the Quakers, Anabaptists, and such like erronious se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced people, and are sent for this very purpose.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63974:42"/> from these errors) to endevor to prove it to this railers face, that he might be ashamed of his railings, but especially of these false Doctrines and base practises brought forth by them, for <hi>Felton</hi> that stabbed the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buchingham,</hi> which was from following the impulse of that spirit within him, contrary to the word of God, that he saith nothing to, for he knowes not how to cloak it, and he was led by this spirit they talke of, and answers to his prayers.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63974:44"/> upon the Crosse, and for whom God accepts this, as he doth for all his Elect, to them his Justice being satisfied, he imputes no sin, but it is cleansed away from them by the bloud of Christ in the sight of God 2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himselfe not imputing their trespasses unto them, that is the elect in the world as you may see, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.29. whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate, and in the next verse, <hi>whom he did predestinate those he called and Justified, this being done, vers.</hi> the 33. <hi>who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, it is God that Justifieth and how?</hi> the 32 vers. <hi>by not sparing his own Sonne but delivering him up for us to death,</hi> that so satisfaction might be made fully to his justice, and that being made by the death and sufferings of the sonne of God, the way that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of his infinite grace and rich mercy found out as that which only could satisfy infinite justice, being the blood of God, as the Apostle in another place cals it, that is, of that person that was God and man in one person, and therefore of an infinite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, this being done, will God impute sinne to those for whom he hath receaved satisfaction and reconciled unto himselfe hereby, not imputing their sins, when this is done, they who are justified onely by what is performed by Christ our Saviour, in his own person, his sufferings accepted for us, and his obedience and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse imputed to us, out of the free grace and mercy of God, for of free grace we are saved, not of any works of our own, as is plain in the Scripture; and I insist the more upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they Iesuitically expect to be justified and saved by Christ, working in them, and suffering in them, which is by their own works, and merits, as shall appeare by their own answers to the Queries: Then I say, they who are thus justified by Christ in his own person, those he sanctifieth by his spirit, not taking away all sinne, but taking away the dominion, and ruling power of sinne; for if sinne were wholy taken away, and men perfect in grace, how can they grow in grace as they are commanded to do? for where there is perfection, there needs no groth nor addition to it; I will now shew his lies, and slanders, and then his devises to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their perfection: first, he saith I am a Ranter, because I say, the guilt of sinne is taken away, and not imputed to us by God,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63974:44"/> though we live in sinne, and under the power of it; this he speak most falsly of me, for in the paper which he so much railes at, it is cleane otherwise expressed by me, as any may read, I say, for whom Christ died, and thereby satisfied the Iustice of God for theirs sins, to those God will not impute sin, nor charge them with the guilt thereof, then there is another cleansing away of sin, which is the power and operation or working of it in our mortal bodies, while we live here in this world, this I say is likewise done by the spirit of Christ in us, which he gives to those whom he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and thereby sinne in us is more and more subdued and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that it cannot have dominion over us; though not wholy taken out of us, doth not this shew his falshood, when he saith, I say men may live under the power of sinne; and in sinne while they live? and yet go to heaven. I say the cleane contrary, that those who are justified by the death of Christ, and therefore sinne not imputed to them, and likewise by the spirit of Christ sanctified, and thereby sin mortified more and more that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rule and raigne in them, but is subdued, that though it be in them, yet it hath not dominion over them that they should ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it in the lusts thereof, as the Ranters say and practice, and I wish that when they think they are perfect, and therefore watch not over their hearts, for what need they when perfect but leave their hearts as needing no guard, nor inspection upon all occasions, to prevent the risings and motions of sinne, fall not into the like abominations as those Ranters live in: and for this deceitfull man to say that I while I live, think I may live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of sinne, and yet go to heaven, because I say that while we live, sinne will have a power to operate in our unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> cals our fleshly members, though resisted and overcome by the graces of the spirit within us, who hath regenerated us, and made us new creatures, though not wholy renewed, for there remaines a fleshly part lusting against the spiritual and regenerate part, so that the Apostle himselfe was so sensible of it that he saith, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> and gives thanks to God that by Jesus Christ he only is delivered, and that manifested unto him by his serving the law of God in his mind, that is, his regenerate part, but yet saith, that in his flesh (the part yet
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63974:45"/> unregenerate the law of sinne, therfore there is a part unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the lusts wherof rise up against the spirituall mind, which loves and obeyes the law of God, resisting those fleshly lusts, and (through the assistance of Gods spirit) subduing &amp; overcomming them, this man I say may as well and with as much reason, call <hi>Paul</hi> a Ranter as me for what I have said, as any sober man who will read the 7th <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The first place he brings, is that in the 3d of the <hi>Philipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the 15th verse, <hi>Let us therefore as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as be perfect be thus minded,</hi> and in the 11th <hi>verse,</hi> he professeth himselfe not to be perfect; were any of those he exhorteth more perfect than himselfe, being his disciples, he their teacher? by this very place the man might see (if he would not shut his eyes to continue in his errors) that perfection in scripture, as here is used in a double sense, the one for perfection in degrees, where there is no degrees of perfection wanting, that the subject is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, this is not attainable unto in this life, until we be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and be with Christ, which is best of all, &amp; this the Apostle saith he hath not already attain'd, and therefore was not already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with this perfection, but did follow after it, and press for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards that marke: and was there a man in the world that was but a mere man and no more, that ever did, or will attaine to a higher degree than <hi>Paul?</hi> yet he had not attain'd to that degree of perfection, which the spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in heaven doe injoy, neither can any in this life attaine to that degree untill they come to heaven, another sense in which the word perfect is taken, is, upright and sincere without hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie; that may be termed perfection of parts not degrees, when a man walks uprightly not as to one thing, and hypocritically and falsly in another; but in all parts of Christianity, one as well as another, is found to be sincere and upright; and hath respect to all the Commandments of God, one as much as another, here is an universall uprightness in all parts of piety, none neglected, and this is termed perfection as to the parts of piety, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but not as to the degrees which are to be waited for, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63974:45"/> pressed forward unto continually while we live, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith he would, not having attain'd thereunto, and then exhorts as many, putting in himselfe, as are perfect to be so minded, <hi>vers:</hi> 15th: now he that is not ignorant, or rather will not be wilful, must needs see the different acceptation of this word perfect as I have expressed it, for else <hi>Paul</hi> should contradict himselfe saying, in one place he was not perfect, and in another he was, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in scripture is sometimes taken for upright, will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in <hi>Job</hi> the 1st and 2d <hi>chapters,</hi> where God calleth <hi>Job</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, and in the next word interprets it upright and sincere, which was his perfection, for, that he was not perfect without sinne is apparent, as God sheweth and he himselfe confesseth in the book of <hi>Job</hi> at the latter end. I have so fully cleared that place, 1 <hi>Epist: of Joh: chap.</hi> 3: <hi>he that is borne of God sinneth not,</hi> shewing that the reason he giveth expounds the place, makeing it not contradict what he had said before, that is, the seed of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and therefore he cannot sinne so as he that is not borne of God, and hath no such seeds of Grace remaineing in him, the one cannot sinne totally without reluctancy, nor final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without repentance, as the other may, for that immortall seed (that by being born of God, doth and ever will remane in him,) will spring up and restore him to his first condition by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance like his companions, as you may see if you will but read their answers to the Querie, and their answers to Mr <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> and Mr <hi>Nyes</hi> confession of faith; so here when he cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the arguments, he railes and cals them my imaginations, and me a person that would live in sinne and in the power of sin, and such like, and that I am one that is a lyar, a dissembling hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and much more; this is the way of their argumentation when they have no answer to make, that I would live in sinne and in the power of sinne, or any other regenerate man. I have shewed it is his lye; for all I sayd, which is the same that <hi>Paul</hi> saith, is, that sinne hath a power to worke and rise up against the grace of God in a regenerate man, but will be resisted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by those graces: then he comes to that place, <hi>he that is borne of God sinneth not,</hi> but answereth nothing that I have said in it, but cals them my imaginations and lyes, there is his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63974:46"/> now I will aske this railer, whether <hi>David</hi> were not borne of God, when God saith he was a man according to his his own heart, yet <hi>David</hi> fell into grievous sins after he was regenerate, but the seed of God remaneing in him, restored him againe by true repentance; and whether <hi>Peter</hi> were not borne of God, when Christ himselfe ownes him to be so, yet he fell into a great sinne of denying his Master for feare, but by the grace of God in him repented and wept bitterly for it, so that by those exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and many more it is apparent, that a man regenerate and borne of God hath corruption remaneing in him, and may fall into sinne, contrary to the false interpretation they make of this place, to justifie their false Tenet by this, <hi>Jobe,</hi> (a man whom God himselfe saith, there was none like him upon the earth) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth fully <hi>chap:</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 30. and he saith, we speak wisdome amongst those that are perfect, I have shewed before how perfect is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, such as are sincere and upright, and for that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith that he might present men perfect in Christ Jesus, I would the man and his companions did or would understand that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then they would not expect to be presented perfect in their own righteousness or perfection; but in the righteousness of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ who is our perfection, and so the Apostle would bring them to believe and to rest therein, then they should be perfect, resting upon the righteousness of the Lord Christ before God, and not upon their own, the best whereof is in that respect no better than dung and dross and filthy raggs. I unfainedly wish that these people who are seduced, many of them I believe having better hearts than those who do seduce them, &amp; who do not at first discover all their wicked doctrines unto them, instead of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within them, &amp; the light, within them (which their Teachers and seducers do so much talk of) had the true spirit of God dwelling in them, which would, as our Saviour saith, convince them of sin, and make them see the strirings &amp; movings of their corruptions within them to their grief, against the working &amp; power of that holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within them, &amp; make them humble themselves for the same, &amp; pray against it, and overcome it, as <hi>Paul</hi> did when he was buffetted by Sathan and did feele a prick in the flesh, which made him fall to prayer, and then received this answer from the Lord, my power

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63974:47"/> require it, and we are lawfully called thereunto: &amp; when this is manifested to be commanded by God, and practised according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both in the old, and also in the new Testament, the prop he would hold up this their error by, is that I expected they would produce, that which our Saviour speakes in the 5th of <hi>Matth:</hi> and therefore I endevoured to shew the true meaning of what our Saviour there taught, consisting with what he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in other parts of the Scripture, and the holyest of men right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understanding him accordingly practised, he doth forbid here vaine swearing in our ordinary communication which the Jewes allowed, so it were not false, and if it were by creatures and the name of God not used, then they might so sweare at pleasure. But our Saviour interpreting the Commandment, sheweth that this interpretation of it was false, and to swear vainly in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary comunications amongst men, as it is too usually amongst us now, And was their doctrine and practice then, is not to be done at all, and this I have shewed clearly enough to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour in that place &amp; of <hi>James</hi> who followed his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and was led by his spirit. The examples of holy men in Scripture being produced, and also the commandment of God, as in the 4th of <hi>Jer:</hi> and other places to shew that upon the due occasion the name of God was to be used with reverence, and in truth, which he could not deny; he had no ther shift to helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but to make the 3d Commandement a ceremony like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and the rest to end at the comming of our Saviour and so cast out of the Morall-law one of the ten Comandments, any of which or all of them, he may make ceremonies, and cast away as well as this, marke his ignorance, or his wilfull continuance in error, in this doctrine of his he may as well say now, the first Commandment is ended and to be laid aside, and when in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative it is commanded we should have no other Gods, now this is at an end, and we need not to obey the affirmative implyed thereby to cleave unto the only one true God, so in the second Commandment wherein we are forbidden to worship God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our own inventions, by Images and Idols, the affirmative implyed thereby as I have shewed, that we ought therefore to worship him according to his institutions and his own ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63974:47"/> not to cast off his worship, and not worship him at all, will the man say these were commandments, but now they are at an end, and we are not to observe them, he may as well say it, as to say what he here doth, that the 3d Commandment is a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and not to be obeyed, both in the affirmative, as well as the negative, not to use the name of God vainly, which doth imply and require, that we ought upon due occasion and calling, to use it with reverence and godly feare, as part of his honor and worship from us, and so we are commanded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.10: and 20: what a false interpretation doth this man make of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's doctrine in this particular, when he would so interpret it? as it must cast out the 3d Commandment out of the morall law as a ceremony, which falshood, our Saviour himselfe in the very place professeth against, testifying that he came not to destroy the law and the Prophets, (wherein this I plead for, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) but to fulfill them, and saith farther, that one jot or title of them should not be taken away, till heaven and earth pass away; let sober Christians consider these erronious doctrines of theirs, &amp; what false shifts &amp; vizards they cover them over with, he talkes of my imaginations; but let sober men see what imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he brings forth to turne the morall law, or any part of it into into ceremonies. I have sufficiently already shewed, that an Oath was not only used, but commanded and required, which now he would have proved, he might have seen it in the paper he so much railes at, but I will adde some places here that he may be seen to be ignorant, and not so well acquainted with the Scriptures, who would have it believed there is no Oath to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of men by the Magistrate. In the 6th to the <hi>Heb. v:</hi> 15. it is there said, that an Oath for confirmation is to men the end of all strife, would the Apostle have named this to be a meanes to end strife, and satisfie men if it had been a ceremony, and to be laid aside and not used amongst men, when there was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them? this being shewed to be allowed, yea to be made use of in the New Testament, which takes away his vaine shift and foolish device, which he useth against that which is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised and commanded in the Old. I will shew that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate did require and command oathes, and was therein to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,

I do not deny but that Christ doth worke in his Saints by his Spirit, but this I say according to the Scripture, that first our blessed Saviour works for us, to justify us before God by what he suffered for us, and by that obedience he did for us to be imputed to us, and then having justified us before God by himselfe alone, he works in us, and never before, to sanctify us by his spirit, and renue us in the spirit of our minds, giving us by the power of his spirit, new hearts, and new spirits, according to the Covenant of grace, that we may walke as those who are by God adopted in him, and justified by him alone, before these works of his be begun in us, for they are the effects onely of our Iustification, they can be no causes of it; no, were they perfect, as they are not untill we come to Heaven, for all the perfection of a creature cannot answer for one sinne committed, were it an Angell, for when he hath done all he can do, he hath but done his own duty, and therefore cannot merit for another, much lesse
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63974:51"/> for himselfe having sinned; God justifieth us freely of his grace, <hi>by grace we are saved, not by any works</hi> which Christ by his spirit works in us; but only by what in his own person he hath done for us according to the grace, and free love of God unto us giving him to be our righteousnesse, and all in all for us, and then he working in us, that we might have grace to shew our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and our love by our obedience, for such a salvation, out of the riches of his grace freely given us; yet all we can doe, and the most holy of men whilst we live here is imperfect; set not your selves above <hi>Paul,</hi> who was taken up into the third heavens, and contradict him not, who saith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. while we are here <hi>we know but in part,</hi> we are not perfect in knowledg, therefore never in action, <hi>we see through a glasse darkly,</hi> and till we come to Heaven, we shall not know not see perfectly and clearly, and will you think that the works of sanctification, which our Saviour worketh in us being imperfect, can justify us? be it far from you to cast your soules upon such a rotten foundation; when you have Christs sufferings for you, and his obedience and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be imputed to you, to rest and rely upon, the satisfaction and merit whereof is infinite; <hi>and there is no other name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whereby we can be saved;</hi> and if you will delude your selves with this, that the works in you, <hi>be Christs alone;</hi> that is false, for when he works by his grace in us, he sanctifieth our faculties, re-renueth our harts and minds, our understandings, and our wills, and makes use of them in every work he makes us to doe; so that, as he works in us by his spirit the graces which inables us to act, so he works also by us; and our parts and faculties are fitted, and used by him to doe our duty, according to the measure of grace by him given unto us; and therefore if we were Iustified by his working in us only, then we should part stakes with him in our Iustification by our own works, and so might bost of our selves, that we were not justified, nor saved of free grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our selves, it being done by the works within us, which we have a part and share in, for our parts and abilities are made use of to that end, let this be abhorred of every Christian; and that it is a piece of Popery, it is plain enough: I confesse I have been long to clear up this point, because it is of that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63974:51"/> and my desire to make it clear, is out of my love to them, whatever they shall think, or say; for I know that salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon a right understanding and practise hereof.</p>
                  <p>Now I will come to shew that the seducers of these people, do maintain this damnable Doctrine; and I hartily wish they might see it and abhorre it; I will begin with what one of their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent proselites (as the man cals him) and it seems thereby, that he was of high esteem amongst them, said to an Inhabitant in <hi>Bristoll, art thou such a foole, as to hope to be saved by Jesus Christ that died at Jerusalem</hi> 1600 <hi>yeares agoe?</hi> here is their horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the Sonne of God, that loved us, and then, and there gave himselfe for us, to redeem us from wrath to come, by bearing the wrath of God for us, in his soule and body upon the crosse; It may be, it will be said, this is one of <hi>Farmers</hi> lies, for that is their usuall answer; it was spoken he saith to a man of credit in the Citty, who will make it good upon his Oath; you may say, this was but the speech and error of one man, and that concernes not all of you; I will therefore shew that your Teachers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this in their answers to the Queries, though not fully, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some gloses put upon it, to cover the foulnesse of such an error; and indeed their answers are so railing with such base termes, and judging men all along, and calling them reprobates, and damned beasts, and such like; and withall considering not the question, but with these railings, and so ending; that any Christian, yea any civill and rationall man would detest it in the reading of it, as any of you may see, if you will but read it; I confesse it is hatefull and troublesome unto me, to read such rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and cossening shifts, for they avoid to make any direct answers.</p>
                  <p>In the answer to the second querie, after he had railed like a Divell (as he doth in all) he calls him, <hi>thou Ante-Christ,</hi> and why? because he looks at Christs death at Jerusalem alone, and cannot confesse him any otherwise, but <hi>without</hi> thee; there (though he will hardly speak out plainly) yet it is apparent enough, that to rest upon Christ that died at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> offering himselfe there once a sacrifice for our sins, and to rely upon what he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for us, without us, and not in and by us, this is not that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63974:52"/> which they expect to be justified by; but by that which is done in them, and suffered in them, which is plane Popery.</p>
                  <p>In the answer to the fourth querie, whether the death the <hi>man Christ</hi> suffered once at Jerusalem, and but once upon the crosse, were not so satisfactory for all the sins of the Elect, that the Justice of God, did not, doth not since require any suffering, or working upon that account, either from sinners or Saints.</p>
                  <p>After railing and equivocating (not answering directly) he comes at last to say, <hi>let thy mouth be stopped thou lier, who art of the lake, who queries, whether the Justice of God be not satisfied for the sins of the Elect, and then tells him, he cannot read in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God doth require satisfaction for the sinnes of the Elect, or lay any thing to their charge, when he is satisfied by the Lord Christ for their sins, he then doth not lay any thing to their charge; but, that God doth not require satisfaction for their sins that are elected, and receive it, by the satisfaction made by Christ, in his offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a sacrifice for sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there is no need of Christ at all, for he came onely for the Elect, and laid down his life for them, and not for those who were not Elected, as himselfe saith, <hi>I laid down my life for my sheep, but you are not of my sheep,</hi> Ephes. 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. those whom he hath chosen and predestinated (which are onely the Elect) those have redemption by the blood of Christ, and thereby forgivenesse of sinnes; doth not God then receive satisfaction for the sinne of the Elect, when their sinnes are not forgiven but upon the blood of Christ shed for them? So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. what a hatefull Doctrine is this which they have often expressed in these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? and it tendeth to nothing else but this, that Christ needs not make satisfaction for the Elect; they are not defiled (they say in these Queries, as <hi>Quere</hi> 11.) and then it will come to this, that they need not the satisfaction of Christ made at Ierusalem, but they have Christ within them that satisfieth for them, and the Elect have no sinne to be satisfied for, and therefore Christ, <hi>which died at Jerusalem,</hi> they will say, they own; but cunningly, for they meane, to be a figure and an example onely; a Christ so farre off, and so long agoe, as the base erronious Socinians hold, and these are charged with the same, in a brie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This is their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher <hi>Atkinson,</hi> in his answer to the confession of faith. If Christ our Saviour be not God and man in one person, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 20th of the <hi>Acts, vers.</hi> 28: could not truly have said, that that the Church of God (which he admonished them to feed) <hi>God had purchased with his own blood;</hi> it must be therefore God and man in one person; <hi>Nayler</hi> (their false Christ) wrote to one in Lancashire in a letter, <hi>that he who expected to be saved by him that dyed at Jerusalem should be deceived.</hi> But I have so long raked in this filthy dunghill, of blasphemous unchristian er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and damnable, that I am weary of it; I will leave off the rest, having done this out of my desire, that my neighbours might be kept from harkening unto such sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, that run up and downe to doe the Divels worke, and Overthrow the doctrine of the Gospel, wholly; only there is one dangerous, and most false doctrine of theirs, which they are much spreading abroad, and indeed that which makes way for the rest very much, which I omitted in the paper which this man railes so much against; and therefore I will discover the falshood and danger thereof here, this fellow having given me this occasion.</p>
                  <p>Their false Tenent is this, <hi>that there is that light and power in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, that if he take heed to it, and wait, and look to the light within him, there he shall find his Saviour;</hi> so that, <hi>a Saviour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him dying at Jerusalem,</hi> and satisfying the Justice of God by his once offering up himselfe a sacrifice for sin, this is a <hi>carnall Christ,</hi> they say, and nothing but a Type, a Figure; an example, but looking to the light within them, there they shall find their Saviour within them; see it in a book called <hi>Truthes defence,</hi> pag.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63974:53"/> 86. and <hi>pag.</hi> 95, this is to deny Christ our Saviour, blessed for ever, and his death and suffering for us at Jerusalem, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the suffering of Christ now in the Saints, to be satisfactory for sinne past, present, and to come, which is nothing (as hath been said) but our own sufferings and works within us; this you may see in <hi>Howgill,</hi> and <hi>Barne,</hi> in their answer to the 7 Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But this tenent of theirs goeth farther, for they hold that every man that comes into the world, hath such a light in him, that if he look unto it, and follow it, that will save him, and if so, what need they a Christ at all to be their Saviour? for they may save themselves, if they will take heed to that light within them, and follow that which they brought into the world with them, and this they take from misunderstanding that place of Scripture; <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 9: where it is said, that <hi>Christ was the true light, which lightneth every one that came into the world,</hi> therefore they pretend, every on by nature (vvhich is all on, that every on that came into the world) hath such a light, as vvill bring him to heaven if he follovv it; vvhat need he then be <hi>borne again</hi> by the spirit? as our Saviour saith, or else he <hi>shall not enter into the kingdome of heaven;</hi> if his naturall birth bring into the vvorld vvith him, light enough vvithin him to save him. This is a gross mistake of that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1: vvhere the Apostle, to shevv that Christ vvas God, speakes of his creating of all things, and so of man, to vvhom as he gave a body, so he gave also a rationall soule.</p>
                  <p>Now this rationall soule is <hi>that light,</hi> which every man brings into the world, which before the fall of man, was sufficient to carry him on in the wayes of God unto everlasting happiness, but after his fall into sinne, loosing thereby the image of God (in which he was created) his light became darkness, yea and enmity against God, and <hi>foolishness,</hi> as the Apostle saith; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must know, that the naturall light which remaineth in man, which is the use of reason and natural wisdome, is so far from saving a man, that it will oppose all the wayes and meanes of salvation; for it is called <hi>darkness,</hi> as (I have said) enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and foolishness; <hi>the wisdome of the flesh is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and the wisdome of this world is foolishness.</hi> The best light that is in a naturall man, his very wisdome, is not only an enemy, but in the abstract, <hi>enmity</hi> it selfe against God, and will
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63974:53"/> that (if it be looked unto) carry us to God? no, it will make every such man fight against God, and all his Commands. You are therefore ignorant people, if you ever think to come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by observing the naturall light within you, which is your delusion, for it is darkness, ever opposing the true light delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the word of God, the Apostle saith, <hi>Eph:</hi> 5.8: <hi>you weare some times darkness,</hi> when they were in the state of nature, <hi>but now you are light in the Lord;</hi> There is a naturall light, which is the rational soule, this is enmity against God, and there is a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall light, when the spirit renewes us in the spirit of our minds, and gives us the true light revealed by God unto his in his word, when we walke as children of this light and make that our rule, then we make strait steps and pathes unto our selves, and that word of light will justify us at the last day; but you that will follow a light within you, which you brought into the world with you, <hi>Enthusiasmes high flowne,</hi> and indeed foolish fancies never examined, nor tryed by the true light, the word of God, according to which, if your light within you speak not, it is darkness; you will by this device of Sathan (as I have said) certainly be drawne into desperate, if not damnable errors. When I speak of their uncivill carriage towards men, not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon them when they pass by, nor shewing any respect at all in word, or action, and doe shew that this is contrary to the commands of God, and examples of godly men both in the old and new Testament, let any rationall man observe his answers, and he will see he makes no solid answer at all to the commands or practises instanced in, but judging, and false accusing which will bring Judgment upon themselves, for because I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and endeavour to bring them from their uncivill, and unmanly behaviour tovvards men, shevving no respect to them in vvord or deed, he vvill judge I doe it out of pride, and that I might be honoured, and shevv my high mind, and then brings his curses, and poptuers them out upon me; are these ansvvers to vvhat is alleaged and proved out of scripure? they are indeed their usuall ansvvers, for my desiring their cap and knee (as he cals it,) In respect of my selfe, I regard it no more, then to see an ox or a cow to goe by me vvith their hornes upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63974:54"/> their head; but in respect of them it grieveth me, because I see in it an intollerable pride in them, which they by their slanders cast upon others, &amp; have not light to see it in themselves; for my affecting pride, I leave the judgment of that to others, who know my conversation, and have been acquainted with it many yeares; if the poorest man or woman should meet me, and shew a respect unto me, I think my selfe bound to answer it againe with the like, and ever have done so; but these men will make whom they will, and all that be not of their delusion, and join not with them therein, <hi>haters of Sion,</hi> as this man cals mee; and then brings that place, 129. <hi>Psalme:</hi> where the judgments of God are denounced against the wicked, and men must not pray to God for a blessing upon them, and another place, that a man must not bid him <hi>God speed</hi> that abides not in the doctrine of Christ; the man either doth not, or will not understand the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these places of Scripture, that he may pervert them to his own ends; we are to make prayers and supplications for all men, that they may be converted, and come to the knowledge of the truth, as we are commanded, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> the 2. <hi>chap.</hi> &amp; I do for these Quakers (though I know they abide not in the doctrine of Christ) that they might be reduced from their error, ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the way of truth; but that which is intended in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by him mentioned is, that we should not give any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or approbation to them in their evill wayes, and false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; and that, because I doe not, I am so much railed upon, as this man doth here all his paper over; I pray for them, and desire their good, which made me write what I did; but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them in their manifest errors would do them hurt.</p>

                  <p>He then saith, <hi>doe thou prove by any command, or example in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that men were to put off their hats one to another, and call that honour:</hi> observe his deceitfulness herein, which he so often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly chargeth me withall; belching out many other base slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; he will speak here only of putting off hats: of the bowing the knee (as he saith) and of bowing downe to shew reverence and obeisance, not a word of that here see his cunning, which he so often falsly chargeth me withal; for <hi>putting of hats,</hi> it was not used in the Easterne Countries, neither is it at this day; they wore and doe so still <hi>Turbans,</hi> which were not pulled off, neither

If there were certaine dangers in meeting in the day time, there might then be some reason for meeting in the night, and in secret, as in the Apostles times sometimes there was; but now there is no such cause, and therefore it is of evill report; for that of <hi>Pauls</hi> being at <hi>Troas,</hi> they met in the day, upon the Lord's day in the morning, but because that holy Apostle who had stayed there untill the sabboth, was to depart the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and whether they should ever see his face any more they knew not, therefore that they might advantage themselves the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63974:61"/> more by his presence with them, they spent the whole Sabboth with him, both day and night from morning to morning; here was a just occasion for it; which they desired to make advantage of while they could, so when <hi>Peter</hi> was to be put to death (by the <hi>Tirant</hi>) the next morning, the Saints would not cease from praying for his deliverance, while there was any time for them to doe it; and it may be, they would have been killed as well as he, if it had been kown they had done so; by that persecutor who sought to please the Jewes by destroying the Apostles and their followers, in both these, there was a lust occasion which he would make use of to justify those unseemly and unlawfull night-mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and of evill report, for which there was no need at all nor no reason, for the day might as well have been taken, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all scandall and offence: after these silly arguments, he comes in with his base lies, base fellow; <hi>that I did it out of great feare, and that there was great danger, and this feare,</hi> he saith, <hi>did surprise the heart of the hyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63974:61"/> my paper will manifest his lie, I say, as the Apostle faith, we are not perfect, and free from all sinne while we live, for we know but in part, and sinne hath a power and operates in our unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part, to resist and rise up against the regenerate and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; but when we are Justified by faith in Christ; we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sanctified by his spirit, whereby sinne is more and more mortified in us, so that it hath not dominion over us, that we should fulfill it in the lusts thereof and these are the very words. I said, the same with the Apostle, who saith, he is not perfect, but strives still forwards towards the marke, and though in his body and fleshly part, sine resisteth the spirit, yet in his spirit he serves the law of God and delights in so doing, and yet because of that sinne that remanes, he cannot do as he would, and this I wrote then, as may appeare, and affirme now; is this railer, lier, and false accuser, and judger of other men (for which he will be judged) a man perfect and without sinne? when the Apostle, saith he himselfe is not? let men judg whether he hath not sufficiently manifested his sinne, in this railing lying paper of his; had they the true spirit of God, instead of that lying spirit within them, that would convince them of sinne, as our Saviour saith, <hi>John.</hi> 16.8. and being convinced of sinne, and truly humbled for it, they would then seek after righteousnesse, whereof likewise they (by that spirit) would be convinced, and find it in Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, not in their own works, or the works of Christ in them, as they call them; but know, in respect of Justification, all that can be done in them is but dung, and so to be accounted with the Apostle, that they may win Christ, and have his righteousnesse imputed to them, I would bring them to know, and believe this, without which they can never be saved.</p>
                  <p>Now the ignorant man that would be thought perfect, and yet understands little of the true sence of Scripture, would find out a contradiction in what I have written, because speaking of night meetings, and avoiding the ill reports thereof, and appearances of evill, I presse it, by shewing, <hi>they should keep themselves unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how would I have them unspotted?</hi> that, I say, <hi>have sinne in them while they live;</hi> for sinne ruling in them, and having domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I say no such thing, that is his lie, for keeping themselves
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63974:62"/> unspotted in the world, and unspotted in the sight of God, these two are different, unspotted in the sight of God, no man can be, but he that is offered up to God in our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot or wrinkle,</hi> justified by his satisfaction for sinne upon the Crosse, and having his righteousnesse imputed to him; then, and no other way he is without spot in the sight of God, for God doth not, being satisfied in his justice, impute sinne to such a man: unspotted and without blame in the world, is cleane ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that is, when men walke so in the sight of men, that that they do nothing scandalous, or that may give just offence to any man, or occasion of evill report; but in their conversation with men walke unblameably, and this a man may doe, though there be weaknesses in him, and failings in the sight of God, his watchfulnesse over himselfe being never so great; his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation amongst men, may be of good report and without spot, and not to be blamed as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, of himselfe before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.6. so that this proceeds from the mans igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or malice, for it might be taken in such a sence (as it often is in Scripture) without contradicting the truth I formerly spoke: when I say the dangerous, and indeed damnable errors which I discovered to be held by these Quakers, it was out of my love to my neighbours; that (if it might be) I might reduce them off from these errors, which indeed I did much desire; then the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low railes like a Jesuit, and lies according to his custome, saying, <hi>that many of my neighbours by this see my wicked accusations and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane spirit,</hi> if he meane those deluded people which are led by such liers and false accusers as himselfe, whose falshood, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Scripture, or malicious hypocrisy, in perverting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to serve his turne, I have sufficiently discovered if they be brought to think, so I wonder not at it, but for their sakes I am grieved, that they will not endure wholsome doctrine, but heap up to themselves rather such teachers as teach them lies and false doctrines, directly contrary to the word of God, some of these I think have honester minds then their Anabaptisticall and Iesuiticall teachers, who will not at first discover all the depths and delusions of Sathan unto them, but by degrees draw them down, untill they have cast them into the bottome of their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63974:62"/> pit, all I have read, some of them said, they have somethings yet to deliver, which the world is not fit to receive, this is very likely to be kept in their Iesuiticall breasts from these people, untill they think, they are fitted to swallow it; I would they would take notice of this, and observe the proceedings of Sathan by thesk his instruments, set on worke to delude them and destroy them.</p>
                  <p>For other of my neighbours, they will to his face convince him of his perfection in lying, for they received very lovingly what I writ, as I did it out of love, and did make use of it (I hope) to their good, as I have heard of some; for railers and liers (as this man) I am not troubled at, in respect of my selfe, but for them; I wish for their good they might repent for it, and thereby see how farre they are, poore soules, from perfection, and how nere rather to distruction; his conclusion is railing against Mr <hi>Farmer,</hi> and my selfe, and often repeats this, <hi>that we slander the Servants of the Lord, and those that feare him, and tremble at his word;</hi> I should be glad to finde them returne to be servants of the Lord by true repentance, and for their trembling at the word, if they mean Quaking and those distorted unseemly gestures used there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I have shewed before how farre this is from the working of the word upon them, For 1. Children did it, 2. And when it was done, the word was not heard, but they in a condition ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of possession (as the child brought to our Saviour) then any way affected with the word: 3 and if it were trembling at the word, or reverence thereunto, why is it left? the word is as much to be reverenced now as then; For Mr <hi>Farmer</hi> he layeth open their blasphemies, and their damnable doctrines so fully, that I would we had so much reverence of the name and glory of our God, as to tremble when we read it, and this he proves out of their own writings, andby testimony from their own mouthes, I am unwilling to name them againe they are so horrid: looke upon <hi>Isaiah</hi> 40.18. where God saith <hi>whom will you liken unto me, all the nations are as nothing, as a drop of a Bucket, a dust upon the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;</hi> these blasphemers will say, we will liken our selves unto him, for they are as good as God, as holy as God, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And Mr <hi>Bray Dauley</hi> having sent me the book and desired me to answer it, I the rather did it, that I might (if it may be) discover to him their desperate, and false tenents, errors, and blasphemies, and draw him from them; but having done this let them raile, or lie, and slander, as is their custome; I will trouble my selfe no more with any thing they write, except it be to cast it into the fire.</p>
